1. AMERICA: LAND OF OPPORTUNITY  America is known as the land of opportunity, where one could achieve anything  they put their mind to, no matter who they are. Thousands of people immigrate to  the United States every year from different parts of the world to have access to these  kinds of opportunities. This is what is known as "the American dream". One of the  many reasons America is such a great country is the diversity you see all around.
 America is one big melting pot of citizens from different backgrounds.
 America is also home to many of the world's top colleges and universities. The  California Institute of Technology is a top world-ranked college that focuses highly on  science and engineering. It is located in the city of Pasadena. Harvard University is  another top world-ranked college that you might be familiar with. The buildings at  Harvard date all the way back to the year 1636, making Harvard the oldest university  in the United States. It is located in the state of Massachusetts. University of  California, Los Angeles, is another institute worthy of recognition. Located next to  Hollywood, UCLA has distinguished itself as a prestigious and selective university due  to the number of people who apply for admission throughout the United States. The  universities mentioned are but a few of the many other excellent schools that make  the United States so outstanding.
 America is also known for being at the forefront of freedom and equality. Although  our history may be contradictory to these ideals, we have progressed and now live in  a land of equal opportunity. Whether you wish to become a doctor, a lawyer, or a  librarian, America is the best place to be at to achieve these dreams.
2. THE FOURTH OF JULY  The Fourth of July is the United States' celebration of its independence from  England. It is the day when the Declaration of Independence was adopted by the new  country's forefathers, and is a national holiday. It has been celebrated every year  since 1776. Americans hold this day as one of the most revered holidays in the  country.
 Independence Day celebrations include firework shows that are held by various  organizations throughout the country. The shows are held at stadiums, recreational  parks, and private homes. Additionally, many businesses have giveaways and special  discounts for all residents on this day. The firework shows are best at stadiums,  where they attract a large number of people. This is a recent change in the way  Americans celebrate the day. In the past, most people bought their own fireworks  from vendors who sell their goods in supermarket parking lots.
 The reason many cities no longer allow the sales, or use of fireworks is because of  the fire hazards they pose. This is why the large, professional celebrations stadiums  and parks have become popular in recent years. Of course, many people still  celebrate at home though. There are some cities where sales and use of fireworks are  still legal, and many Americans take full advantage of this.
 Another Fourth of July tradition is the backyard barbeque. The holiday occurs in  the middle of summer, and Americans love to grill outdoors to avoid the heat inside  the house. Hamburgers and hot dogs are the food of choice, but steaks are also  prepared often. There is nothing better than a great American meal and a cold drink  celebrating the Fourth of July. It is a popular holiday, and it is one that has great  meaning to most Americans.
3. THE U.S. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT  The United States government is composed of three major sections. It is based on  the Constitution of the United States of America that was put into effect in May,  1789. The three parts of the U.S. Government are the executive, legislative, and  judicial branches. Each branch works independently of the other two, and each has its  own responsibilities. This system is in place to ensure that no branch can carry more  power than the other. This is called the separation of powers, which was written into  the Constitution.
 The executive branch is the branch that most Americans are familiar with. It  includes the president of the United States, the vice-president, and the cabinet. The  president is the leader of the country and is the commander-in-chief of the U.S.
 military. The vice-president is second-in-command, and will act as president if the  president dies, resigns, or is removed from office. The cabinet acts as agents of the  U.S. President, and carry out the duties they are entrusted with.
 The legislative branch of government consists of the House of Representatives,  and the Senate. Together they form the congress, which can levy and collect taxes,  mint money, and establish federal courts. It can also declare war, and raise and  support the army, navy, and air force to protect the country. The House of  Representatives has 435 members, and the Senate consists of 100 senators, with two  from each of the states. Any legislation, or new law, must be approved by both the  House of Representatives and the Senate.
 The judicial branch is entrusted to apply the laws created by the legislative branch  of government. It has the power to create lower courts under the Supreme Court of  the United States. It works closely with state courts, although they are separate.
4. CHRISTMAS - A HOLIDAY OF TRADITIONS  Christmas, observed on December 25, is a Christian holiday that celebrates the  birth of Jesus Christ. Christians of different denominations go to church on Christmas.
 Many Catholics go to midnight mass. In the United States, however, the holiday has a  much more secular tone, and is celebrated throughout the country. Many people,  regardless of their religion, put up and decorate a Christmas tree. The tree can be a  real evergreen or it can be an artificial tree. Lights, strings, tinsel, and even popcorn  can be used to decorate a Christmas tree. On the top of the tree is a star or an angel.
 The decorations are usually red and green.
 The purpose of a Christmas tree is to have a central location to place gifts.
 According to legend, a jolly fat man with a beard, named Santa Claus, leaves  presents under the tree. Children in the U.S. often write lists of things they want  Santa to bring them. Many parents bring their children to shopping malls across the  country to tell a man dressed as Santa what they want. These children are often also  photographed with the mall Santa as a keepsake. On Christmas Eve many children  leave milk and cookies for Santa. Of course it is the parents that buy the gifts from  the wish lists, and even eat the cookies and drink the milk. On Christmas Day  children usually wake up early and run to the tree so they can see what Santa  brought them. Adults can also exchange gifts at this time.
 People don't just decorate a tree at Christmas. Many also elaborately decorate  their homes with lights. Some of the displays are even synchronized to Christmas  songs called carols. Originally these songs were religious, but now they are about the  spirit of the season.
5. NEW YEAR'S DAY - A HOLIDAY OF NEW BEGINNINGS  New Year's Day officially begins as soon as people yell "Happy New Year" at  midnight. Most people continue partying well after midnight into the wee hours of the  first day of the new year. In fact, many New Year's parties include breakfast or  brunch. Sometimes at the stroke of midnight there will be fireworks and couples  often kiss. One of the most famous New Year's celebrations takes place in New York  City's Time Square, where a huge cut crystal ball drops at midnight in front of  millions of people standing in the cold. Many more millions watch on television. Some  groups, called Polar Bear Clubs, jump into the cold ocean water on New Year's Day as  a literal way to start the new year fresh.
 New Year's Day, January 1, is a national holiday in the United States. This means  that schools, banks, government offices, and post offices are closed. Given how much  people tend to drink alcohol on New Year's Eve, many people wake up on New Year's  Day with a hangover. The national holiday is a good day to recover.
 Many people go out partying with their friends on New Year's Eve; many people  use New Year's Day to visit family members. New Year's Day is also when many  people start on their New Year's resolutions. A resolution is a promise to change a  lifestyle habit. The most common resolution is to lose weight. Many people also join  gyms as part of their resolutions.
 On New Year's Day there are also parades such as the famous Tournament of  Roses Parade in Pasadena, California, where all the floats are made of different  colored roses and they compete for awards. Many people also watch college and  professional football games, including the Rose Bowl, which is also held in Pasadena,  California.
6. MARTIN LUTHER KING JR. DAY - TO REMEMBER A CIVIL  RIGHTS LEADER  The third Monday in January is an American federal holiday, Martin Luther King Jr.
 Day. It falls near the birthday of the civil rights leader, who was assassinated in 1968.
 King, a minister, became known for non-violently protesting the treatment of African Americans in the United States and laws that discriminated against Blacks.
 Specifically, King protested segregation that separated blacks and whites in public  restrooms, public pools, public schools, on buses, and at restaurants. King led many  marches in the United States, especially in the South where segregation was  especially practiced and enforced, and in Washington D.C. His march on Washington  D.C. was perhaps his most famous one, where he gave the "I have a Dream" speech.
 On Martin Luther King Jr. Day, federal, state, and local offices are closed, including  public schools and post offices. On the holiday many people participate in marches  and vigils remembering Dr. King. Others use the day as a day of service and  volunteer in their community by cleaning up garbage in a local park or serving food  to the homeless. However, the holiday was controversial. Some states didn't want to  honor Dr. King and tried to rename the holiday or combine the day with another  holiday.
 Only two other people have a U.S. national holiday, Christopher Columbus and  George Washington. Martin Luther King Jr. Day became a holiday in 1983 after  pressure from civil rights activists and marches, similar to the ones King used to lead.
 Efforts to create a King holiday began the same year King was killed. The first state  to recognize King Day as a holiday was Illinois. The last state to recognize the holiday  was Arizona.
7. VALENTINE'S DAY - A HOLIDAY OF LOVE AND  FRIENDSHIP  Valentine's Day, February 14, is a holiday that celebrates love and friendship in  the United States. Most people think of it as a romantic day to show the one you love  how much you care by purchasing cards and gifts. Valentine's Day is also an  extremely commercial holiday. People spend money on flowers, balloons, chocolate,  stuffed animals, and jewelry. People also go out for expensive dinners. Valentine's  Day is even celebrated by school children, who give thank-you cards to their  teachers. Some high schools have Valentine's Day dances. Classmates give each  other little cards. These cards can be purchased at any store with famous cartoon  characters. It is considered much more thoughtful to have kids make handmade  cards to give to friends and teachers.
 Valentine's Day is also a great day to announce your love to someone like a secret  crush. Some people even get married on Valentine's Day. However, you don't have to  be in love to share in the festivities. You can say "Happy Valentine's Day" to friends  and coworkers.
 Valentine's Day is not an official holiday though in the U.S., meaning government  offices and schools are open as usual. The date used to be the celebration of a Saint  named Valentine who allegedly saved a young girl's life. It wasn't until the Middle  Ages that romance somehow got mixed in with the date and lovers would send each  other handwritten love notes. Back then you couldn't just go to the store and buy a  card the way you can now.
 You know Valentine's Day is around the corner when stores begin to decorate with  red and pink hearts and the symbol of Cupid, a winged ancient Roman god said to  strike the hearts of people with his arrow. Now it seems Cupid goes straight after  your wallet because you will also see many more jewelry ads as Valentine's Day  approaches.
8. ST. PATRICK'S DAY - A HOLIDAY TO CELEBRATE THE  IRISH  Saint Patrick's Day, March 17, is a Christian religious holiday that celebrates the  patron saint of Ireland. According to the legend, St. Patrick drove all the snakes out  of Ireland. St. Patrick's Day has also become, especially in the United States, a day to  celebrate Irish culture. In major cities across the country like in New York and  Boston, there are parades and festivals. People wear green and decorate with  shamrocks, a type of three-leaf clover. Some people wear buttons or tee shirts that  say "Kiss me, I'm Irish". In the U.S. St. Patrick's Day is not a legal holiday, meaning  government offices and schools are open.
 The biggest and oldest parade takes place in New York City. It actually began  about 250 years ago before the U.S. was even its own country. Every year thousands  gather along to watch hundreds of Irish step dancers and bagpipe players march.
 Irish step dancing is done in groups or solo. Dancers perform complicated moves with  their feet and legs while keeping their upper bodies stiff. The parade has also been a  source of controversy because the parade is associated with the Catholic Church in  New York City; gay and lesbian organizations have not been allowed to march. Many  people protest the parade or boycott it.
 St. Patrick's Day has also become associated with the drinking of a lot of alcohol,  specifically beer. One drink that is often seen around the holiday is "Green Beer". This  is really just regular beer with green food coloring. Many people feel like the holiday  celebrates stereotypes about the Irish, like the myth that they all like to drink and  get drunk. Others complain that the holiday has become too focused on drinking,  with public drunkenness as a problem in major cities around the holiday.
9. PASSOVER - A JEWISH HOLIDAY OF REMEMBERING  Passover is a Jewish holiday that remembers and celebrates their liberation from  ancient Egyptian slavery as described in the Old Testament of the Bible. It is  traditionally celebrated in the spring and lasts about a week.
 According to the story in the Bible, God punished ancient Egypt with 10 plagues.
 The last plague killed Egyptian first-born males. Jewish people were told to mark  their doors with lamb's blood so that God would know to pass over these houses and  not kill any first-born males inside. This is where the name of the holiday, Passover,  comes from. After this last plague the Egyptian king, known as the Pharaoh, agreed  to release the ancient Jews from bondage. The Bible story also says that the Jewish  people left their homes in such a rush after they were freed that they didn't have  time to wait for the bread to rise. This is why at the commemorative Passover meal,  Jewish people eat matzo, bread without yeast, also known as unleavened bread. The  matzo and other foods are eaten at a special meal called a seder.
 There are very specific rituals that happen at the Seder meal. These rituals are all  in a book called the Haggadah. Inside the Haggadah is also the story of the Jewish  exodus from Egypt. During the seder meal parts of the Haggadah are read aloud. The  first part of the meal is a blessing over wine. The second part of the meal is the  washing of hands. The third part of the meal is when someone dips some sort of  vegetable in salt water and then eats the vegetable. The vegetable symbolizes the  humble origins of the Jewish people. The water symbolizes their tears. The fourth  part of the meal is when three pieces of matzo are broken.
10. EASTER - AN IMPORTANT CHRISTIAN HOLIDAY  Easter is a Christian holiday that celebrates the resurrection of the dead of Jesus  Christ as told in the Bible. Christians are found in church on Easter. Some Christians  participate in an Easter vigil or nighttime mass, sometimes held by candlelight.
 Easter is never on a set date. It is observed on a Sunday between the end of March  and the end of April. The exact date is calculated based on a different calendar. Many  public schools in the U.S. have a week-long vacation around Easter time. Sometimes  this break is called Easter or Spring break.
 In the United States, Easter is also celebrated as a secular holiday. It is associated  with the beginning of spring and symbolized by bunnies, flowers, and dyed eggs.
 Many children in the U.S. believe in a fictional character called the Easter Bunny.
 According to the myth the Easter Bunny leaves baskets full of candy for children.
 Sometimes these baskets are hidden and the children have to find them on Easter  Sunday morning. Candy that is usually inside an Easter basket can include chocolate  in the shape of bunnies or chicks, jellybeans, and marshmallows.
 Another activity associated with Easter is an Easter egg hunt. According to  popular mythology, the Easter Bunny hides painted eggs and children need to find  them. While real eggs used to be used, now it is common to use plastic eggs filled  with candy. There are usually public Easter egg hunts in parks across the country.
 The White House even hosts an Easter egg hunt. Another Easter tradition associated  with Easter is dying real eggs in different, usually pastel, colors like light pink, blue  and yellow.
 In New York City, people take to Fifth Avenue to participate in the Easter Parade.
 The Easter Parade isn't a parade with marching bands and floats. People walk up and  down Fifth Avenue showing off elaborately decorated hats or Easter bonnets.
11. MOTHER'S DAY - A HOLIDAY TO HONOR  MOTHERHOOD  Mother's Day is a holiday that celebrates and honors mothers in the United  States. It is celebrated on the second Sunday in May. It became an official holiday in  the country at the start of the 20th century as a way to honor mothers whose sons  had died in war.
 The holiday is celebrated in a number of ways. People give mothers gifts like  flowers, cards, and jewelry to thank them for all their hard work. A popular symbol of  the holiday is the carnation. This is because when the holiday first began in the U.S.
 people were encouraged to wear a red carnation if their mother was alive or a white  carnation if their mother was dead. Many people take their mothers out for a special  meal. In fact, Mother's Day is the most popular date in the U.S. for people to go out  and eat and it is estimated that people spend billions on meals and gifts. Mother's  Day is also the most popular day to make long distance calls in the U.S. It is the  second most popular gift-giving day after Christmas.
 Since its establishment, Mother's Day has been criticized for becoming highly  commercialized. In fact, the founder of the U.S. holiday, Anna Jarvis, began  protesting the holiday and was even arrested for disturbing the peace for  demonstrating. Jarvis's own mother started the campaign to establish a mother's  holiday during the American Civil War.
 Mothers are not the only people celebrated on this day. All mother figures  including grandmothers, great-grandmothers, stepmothers, and foster mothers are  honored on the holiday. In schools many students make special gifts, including  handmade cards. While widely recognized, Mother's Day is not a federal holiday.
 Many other countries around the world have their own version of Mother's Day.
12. FATHER'S DAY - A HOLIDAY TO HONOR FATHERHOOD  Father's Day is a holiday observed in the United States to honor fathers,  fatherhood, and other paternal figures like grandfathers, stepfathers, and uncles. It is  observed on the third Sunday in June.
 In the early 20th century there was a mining accident in West Virginia that killed  almost 400 men. A push for a day to remember the men killed, who were mostly  husbands and fathers, was the start of a push for a national holiday. This was in  1908. It wasn't until 1972, however, that Father's Day was recognized by law as a  national holiday. This is due in part to the fact that people were resistant to what  they saw as another overly invented holiday meant to just make people spend  money. It wasn't seen as a way to remember the dead or to honor living fathers and  father figures. People weren't entirely wrong. Organizations representing men's  clothing manufacturers put in a lot of money for the holiday to become popular.
 Like Mother's Day, it indeed is a holiday that has become highly commercialized.
 There are greeting cards to mark the day, and stores advertise gifts for Dad. These  gifts traditionally include electronics, ties, and tools. In schools, children often make  cards and other gifts. Father's Day is not a federal holiday even though it is widely  celebrated. Some of the ways Father's Day is celebrated is with meals, especially  barbecues since the holiday falls at the beginning of the summer.
13. MEMORIAL DAY - A HOLIDAY TO REMEMBER FALLEN  SOLDIERS  Memorial Day is a United States holiday to remember the men and women who  have died while serving in the armed forces. The armed forces include all branches of  the U.S. military. Those branches are Army, Navy, Marines, Air Force, and Coast  Guard. Memorial Day is a federal holiday, which means government offices, banks,  post offices, and schools are closed. Memorial Day is always observed on the last  Monday of May. Memorial Day has its roots in the U.S. Civil War when a holiday,  Decoration Day, was established to honor both Union and Confederate soldiers who  died. On Decoration Day people used to "decorate" the graves of deceased soldiers  with flags and flowers. The name Memorial Day became more widely used after World  War II in the late 1940s. However, the holiday wasn't officially called Memorial Day  until 1967.
 Memorial Day is commemorated by ceremonies in cemeteries across the country.
 The most well-known one is held in Arlington National Cemetery near Washington  D.C. Arlington is a military cemetery, meaning only military personnel are buried  there. Volunteers place U.S. flags on military graves at Arlington and other national  cemeteries. There are also parades in honor of fallen service people held in different  towns and cities. Another Memorial Day tradition is flying the U.S. flag at half staff  until noon, meaning it is flown at half its normal height. This is considered a sign of  mourning. The flag is raised to its full height after noon as a sign that the military will  rise up despite the loss. There is also a national Memorial Day concert that takes  place on the lawn of the U.S. Capital.
14. LABOR DAY - A HOLIDAY TO HONOR WORKERS  Labor Day is observed on the first Monday of September. It is a holiday meant to  honor the contributions, both economic and social, of U.S. workers. It has been an  official federal holiday since 1894, meaning that government offices including post  offices and schools are closed.
 It is also widely thought that Labor Day was created as an alternative holiday to  May Day. May Day, especially in the 1800s, had become a protest day, when workers  marched to demand better rights and working conditions. There were often strikes  that ended in violence. At the time, the U.S. government was afraid that May Day  was being led by communists and was having a bad influence on workers. Some  people feel September was also chosen since there are no other holidays between  Fourth of July and Thanksgiving in November.
 On Labor Day there are usually parades in major cities around the country.
 Politicians and labor leaders make speeches and hold press conferences. Labor Day is  also considered the unofficial end of summer. Many people celebrate Labor Day with  trips to the beaches, picnics, and barbecues. Many towns and cities host fireworks on  this day. Many people also take their last summer vacations around this time. Labor  Day is also the beginning of the professional and college football season in the U.S.
 Labor Day has also become an important retail holiday. Many stores have Labor  Day sales to coincide with the start of the school year for many children in the U.S.
 This means that many store workers, while their holiday is being celebrated, have to  work long hours.
15. COLUMBUS DAY -A HOLIDAY TO REMEMBER AN  EXPLORER  Columbus Day is observed on the second Monday of October in the United States,  and in some other countries around the world. For a long time it was observed on a  specific date, October 12. It is named after Christopher Columbus, the Italian sailor  who led three Spanish ships to claim new lands in 1492. There is even a child's poem  remembering the date. It reads, "In 1492, Columbus sailed the ocean blue". Some  people say Columbus "discovered" North America, although not everyone agrees with  this interpretation. For example, Columbus never landed on North America proper. He  only got as far as to the islands in the Caribbean Sea.
 Columbus Day has been a federal holiday since 1937; government offices,  schools, and post offices are closed. Many Italians take the day as a day to celebrate  their own ethnic heritage since Columbus was born in Genoa, Italy. Columbus's  explorations, however, were conducted in the name of Spain. Major cities, like New  York City and San Francisco, host large parades. Some cities, like New York City, also  hold a parade celebrating the Hispanic or Latino community.
 Not everyone thinks Christopher Columbus should be honored. Some states like  South Dakota do not observe the holiday at all. Instead they call the day Native  American Day or Indigenous Peoples' Day. In Hawaii the holiday is also known as  Landing Day or Discoverer's Day. This is because European arrival in North America  meant the loss of land and lives for many Native people. Many people hold protests  or vigils on this day to remember the Native Americans that were killed or enslaved  as a result of the European arrival. Another name for the holiday is "Dia de la Raza"  which translates into English as Day of the Race.
16. HALLOWEEN - A HOLIDAY FOR COSTUMES AND  CANDY  Halloween is on October 31. It is also called All Hallows' Eve or All Saints' Eve.
 This is because, according to some, the holiday has its roots in a Christian holiday  that remembers the dead. Others say the holiday has its roots in the ancient harvest  season traditions of Ireland. In the U.S. though, the focus is less on memories of the  dearly departed or agriculture. It is about kids dressing up in scary costumes and  going door-to-door asking for candy. This is called trick-or-treating.
 When children knock on the door of a house or ring the doorbell, they usually say  "Trick or Treat". The "trick" part is a fake threat signaling that the kids will commit a  prank if they aren't given something delicious. Homeowners then give the children  candy, raisins, or some other food treat. Many homeowners decorate their houses to  prepare for the holiday and let kids know that they are participating and can ring the  bell for candy. Traditional decorations often include jack-o'-lanterns, which are  pumpkins with faces carved into them and candles inside. Jack-o' lanterns were  thought to scare away evil spirits when Halloween was first celebrated among the  ancient Christians. Also turnips, not pumpkins, were originally used. People often  decorate using the colors black and orange.
 Halloween is not just for kids; adults get in on the fun by attending costume  parties. There are often contests for who has the best costume. There are also games  bobbing for apples, where people have to get an apple using only their teeth from a  large bucket of water. Other people celebrate by scaring themselves by going to  haunted houses, homes where people dressed up as ghosts, zombies, and  werewolves and jump out to frighten guests. People also tell scary stories or watch  horror movies.
17. VETERANS DAY - A HOLIDAY HONORING ALL  SOLDIERS  Veterans Day is an official United States holiday observed on November 11th  every year. While Memorial Day remembers those who have died while serving in any  of the branches of the U.S. Armed Forces -- Army, Navy, Marines, and Coast Guard,  Veterans Day honors all members of the armed forces, especially the living. As a U.S.
 federal holiday, government offices and schools are closed, and most people have the  day off from work. Banks are also closed. If November 11th falls on a Sunday, then  the holiday is observed on the following Monday.
 The holiday was first observed after World War I, which ended On November 11  1918. It was called Armistice Day then and was more about celebrating the absence  of war and honoring those that served in that one war. It didn't become known as  Veterans Day until 1954 after World War II and the Korean War, when there were  many more members of the armed forces.
 Many restaurants offer free meals to veterans on the date. There is always a  special ceremony at Arlington National Military Cemetery in Washington D.C. This  ceremony involves a wreath being placed over the grave of The Unknown Soldier.
 Many major cities also hold parades on this date. The U.S. flag is usually flown at  half-mast as a remembrance to those soldiers who have died and many ceremonies  observe a moment of silence for the same reason. In Canada the holiday is called  Remembrance Day. One symbol of the day is the poppy flower. The red poppy flower  is said to represent or be a symbol of the blood of soldiers. Many people wear or give  out poppy flowers on the day.
18. CHANUKAH - A HOLIDAY OF LIGHTS  Chanuka, which can also be spelled as Hanukkah, is an 8-day Jewish holiday. It is  known as the Festival of Lights, which celebrates the dedication of an ancient Jewish  temple in Jerusalem thousands of years ago. According to the Hebrew, or Jewish  Bible, a miracle took place then. A one-day supply of oil miraculously lasted eight  days. The dates of Hanukkah always change, but usually occur anywhere in late  November to Late December.
 The main way people observe the holiday is by lighting a candle on a candelabra,  a special candle holder with space for 9 candles on each of the 8 nights. This  candelabra is called a menorah. Now there are also electric menorahs. Some people  also use oil lamps. The 9th candle space is usually higher than the others and is lit on  every night. This 9th candle is there so that people can see the other candles they  are lighting. So, two lights are lit on the first night, three on the second and so on.
 Some families have the head of household light the candles. Other families share the  responsibility. The menorah is supposed to be placed somewhere visible like in a  window facing the street. The candles are supposed to stay lit for at least 30 minutes  after it gets dark. There are also special prayers people say and holy songs sung  when the candles are lit.
 Schools and government offices are open for Hanukkah since the observances  happen at night. Some families exchange gifts on each night of the holiday. Some  foods traditionally eaten on Hanukkah include latkes, fried potato pancakes, and  doughnuts. These and other fried foods are eaten because they are cooked in oil and  remind people of the oil that lasted for 8 nights. Children play with a special four sided spinning top called a dreidel.
19. THANKSGIVING - FAMILIES COMING TOGETHER  Thanksgiving is a holiday celebrated by many people in the United States and  Canada. In the United States it is celebrated on the fourth Thursday in November and  marks the start of the Christmas season. Some people celebrate Thanksgiving to  remember the first harvest of the pilgrims and puritans, groups of people from  England who immigrated to North America in the 1600s. Some people recreate the  first Thanksgiving and dress up as pilgrims, puritans, and the Native Americans who  are said to have helped the new arrivals find food to survive their first winter.
 Most people, however, see Thanksgiving as one day a year to reflect upon what  they are thankful for. Some families will sit together and take turns saying aloud what  they are thankful for. An important part of Thanksgiving is families coming together.
 Extended family members often travel long distances to share the day with their  loved ones. In the United States Thanksgiving is the busiest travel day of the year.
 People travel in planes, trains, buses, and cars to share a very special meal Thanksgiving dinner.
 What most Thanksgiving celebrations have in common is the food. On  Thanksgiving many families prepare large, elaborate dinners to share with friends  and loved ones. Many of these dinners use ingredients associated with the fall  harvest, like cranberries, potatoes, sweet potatoes, corn, and blueberries. Roast  turkey is the traditional meat served. It is so common that some people call  Thanksgiving Day "Turkey Day". The turkey is usually served with gravy and stuffing.
 Pies are usually served for dessert. The most common pies served are sweet potato,  apple, pecan, and pumpkin.
 Thanksgiving is not just celebrated in the privacy of people's homes. Every year  the President of the United States pardons a turkey, saving it from becoming  someone's meal. In New York City, Macy's, a department store, holds a large parade  with huge balloons of various cartoon characters floating down the street.
20. LOTTERY - A CHANCE AT MILLIONS  In the United States, 43 states, Washington D.C., Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin  Islands, all have their own lottery. A lottery is used for states to raise money.
 Licensed stores sell numbered tickets, or people can pay to choose their own  numbers. When you let a machine pick your numbers, it is usually called a Quick  Pick. Many people play lucky numbers, numbers associated with birthdates or other  important numbers to them. The money earned from selling lottery tickets goes to  pay for schools, roads, bridges, and other public services. Once a week or more, a  drawing is held where the numbers are randomly picked. If your ticket has those  numbers, you could win a cash prize.
 There are different types of lotteries, such as Powerball, Mega Millions, and Lotto.
 Powerball and Mega Millions are known for their large payouts. There are also instant  lottery tickets that are scratch-off cards. The winnings tend to be less money, but  they are extremely popular.
 In the United States, you can play the lottery, or buy a ticket if you are 18 years  or older. If you win, usually you have the option of being paid the entire amount in  one lump sum or of being paid smaller amounts over a number of years. Lottery  winnings are taxable, meaning the amount you actually get is smaller than the  jackpot number. People can buy lottery tickets or play the lottery at many  convenience stores. Lotteries are also very popular since they advertise. There are  many television commercials, radio commercials, and billboards urging people to  play.
 Lotteries have been controversial since they are essentially a form of legalized  gambling. There is concern that it can lead to people becoming addicted to gambling.
 There are also illegal lottery games, usually run by some forms of organized crime.
21. ONE COUNTRY, MANY TAXES  Taxes are special fees charged by a government on the people who live in a  country, state or city. These fees help pay for public services like police, road and  bridge repair, and public schools. In the United States people have to pay national,  state, and local taxes. Income tax is a tax applied to how much money a person  earns in a year. There are both federal and state income taxes. These have to be paid  every year by April 15th. There are special forms the Internal Revenue Service (IRS),  the government agency in charge of collecting taxes, asks people to fill out. There are  tax credits that people with low income, college students, and parents can get. These  credits could mean actually getting money back from the government. This money is  called a tax refund. People can get both a federal and state tax refund. Anyone who  works has to be taxed regardless of the immigration status. Not paying income taxes  could mean a fine or even jail time.
 Payroll taxes are taxes that are taken right out of a person's paycheck. There are  federal and state payroll taxes. These include Social Security and Medicare taxes.
 Social Security taxes pay for the retirement and disability benefits received by  millions of Americans each year. Medicare taxes pay for the federal health insurance  program that covers the elderly and the disabled.
 People who own houses pay property taxes. The amount paid depends on how  much the property is worth. This tax is usually paid once a year. Sales tax is a tax  almost everyone pays. Sales tax is a specific extra percentage charged on nearly all  purchases. Everything from soap to furniture has a sales tax attached when bought.
 The amount of the sales tax is different across states and cities.
22. MEDICAL INSURANCE - MAKING IT EASIER TO GET  HEALTH CARE  Health insurance is one way to pay for health care. Health care includes visits to  the doctor, prescription medication, and emergency services. People can pay for  medicine and doctor visits directly in cash or they can use health insurance. Health  insurance usually means you pay less for these services. There are different types of  health insurance. At some jobs, companies offer health insurance plans as part of a  benefits package. Individuals can also buy health insurance. The elderly, and disabled  can get government-run health insurance through programs like Medicaid and  Medicare. There are many different health insurance companies or plans. Each health  plan has a set of doctors they work with. Once a person picks a plan, they pay a  premium, which is a fixed amount of money every month. Once in a plan, a person  picks a doctor they want to see from that plan. That doctor is the person's primary  care provider.
 Obamacare, or the Affordable Care Act, is a recently passed law that makes it  easier for people to get health insurance. The law requires all Americans have health  insurance by 2014. Those that do not get health insurance by the end of the year will  have to pay a fine in the form of an extra tax when they file their income taxes.
 Through Obamacare, people can still get insurance through their jobs, privately, or  through Medicaid and Medicare. They can also buy health insurance through state  marketplaces, where people can get help choosing a plan based on their income and  health care needs. These marketplaces also create an easy way to compare what  different plans offer. If people cannot afford to buy health insurance, they may qualify  for government programs that offer free health insurance like Medicaid, Medicare, or  for children, a special program called the Children's Health Insurance Program  (CHIP).
23. IMMIGRATION - A BROKEN SYSTEM  Immigration in the United States is a complicated and controversial issue. Since  the founding of the country people have come from different countries in search of a  better life and opportunities. Immigration laws, however, are always changing and  are complicated. This leads to many people coming into the U.S. without proper legal  status. While some people call immigrants who come and stay in the U.S. without the  proper papers "illegals", many consider this term offensive. The more acceptable  term is "undocumented" since they do not have the correct legal documents.
 It is estimated that there are more than 11 million undocumented people in the  Unites States. While some people will say there is no reason for immigrants to be  undocumented in the U.S., there are limits on the number of Green Cards, or legal  permanent resident cards, people from certain countries can get. There are also long  waiting lists, up to 14 years in some cases, for people coming from certain countries,  to apply for legal status in the U.S. Additionally there are a limited amount of visas,  or permits, for people coming into the U.S. with manual labor skills. Millions of  undocumented people have been deported, or sent back to their country of origin  under President Obama.
 In 2013, the U.S. Senate passed an immigration reform bill. The law adds extra  border security along the U.S.-Mexico border, and also makes it easier for immigrants  to become citizens. The bill, which also has to be approved by the House of  Representatives, has not yet been presented or voted on by Congress. Because of  this, many are asking President Obama to take action to protect some of the  undocumented, many of whom have been in the U.S. for many years and have  children that are U.S. citizens.
24. COMMUNITY COLLEGES (1)  The American community college system is a place for second chances.
 Community colleges are two-year schools that thrived in California after the end of  World War II. Many American military personnel were returning to civilian life after  their service to the country. Some of these young people decided not to go to college  after high school so that they could serve their country during that time of need.
 When they returned, many of them turned to the community college system in  California to continue their education.
 The United States government introduced the G.I. Bill at that time giving  returning servicemen and women educational benefits to help them get back to  school. Soon community colleges and new school districts began appearing  throughout the country. Community colleges helped ease returning military personnel  back into college life. It was a low cost, less stressful alternative to going back to a  four-year university.
 Today, community colleges attract students from all parts of the world. In  California, a large population of students comes from Asia and Latin America. These  schools provide a second chance to international students who may have experienced  difficulties attending college in their native countries. American students who may  have not done well academically in high school, and did not enter a university, can  turn to community college for a second chance, too.
 Community colleges provide a much-needed resource for all these students.
 Former military personnel, international students, and high school students alike, are  all welcome. One of the best things about community colleges is that they accept  anyone at anytime. This means people who have not found what they want to do in  life can try more than one area of study. If they don't like one course of study, they  can always try something else. That is the beauty of community colleges.
25. COMMUNITY COLLEGE (2)  These days many people attend community colleges with plans to transfer to a  four-year college or university to get a bachelor's degree. It's kind of like a stepping stone. There are many reasons why people do this. One reason is that some  community colleges have transfer agreements with private and state colleges and  universities that guarantee admission. Even if a community college doesn't have that  agreement of a guaranteed spot in a four-year college, it has articulation agreements  with four-year schools. These agreements tell you exactly what classes a student in a  community college needs to take in order to be able to transfer. These agreements  make sure that students don't waste time taking classes that won't transfer. Most of  these classes one needs to take before transferring are general education classes,  like math and English.
 Another reason why many students start their undergraduate degree at a  community college is a financial one. A four-year college or university is much more  expensive than a two-year college. This is especially true for immigrant students,  who don't qualify for financial aid, loans or scholarships. Also community colleges  tend to offer more evening classes so they can accommodate people who have to  work while attending school. They are also a good option for older students with  families, who need a more flexible schedule while taking care of children. Community  colleges also tend to be commuter schools, meaning people don't have to live on  campus in dorms. Attending a community college means you can still live at home  with your parents, which can save the family a huge amount of money.
 If a student didn't do well in high school, a community college would provide him  or her with another opportunity to enter a four-year university. Community colleges  offer many classes to help students develop their math and writing skills. When you  attend a four-year college, you are expected to have those skills already. Community  college will prepare students to successfully graduate from a four-year school.
26. ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS IN THE U.S.
 Most children in the U.S. begin school at age 5, when they go to kindergarten.
 This is the beginning of elementary or primary school. Most children stay in  elementary schools till they are about 11 years old. Elementary schools are divided  by grades. The youngest children begin in kindergarten at 5, and then go to first  grade, second grade and so on. Most elementary schools go up to fifth or sixth grade.
 The focus of an elementary school is basic academic and socialization skills.
 Mostly children learn how to read, write, count, add, subtract, multiply, and divide.
 Students also learn the rules of English grammar, spelling, and vocabulary. Children  also learn basic social studies or history, science, art, and music skills, and participate  in gym or physical education. In elementary schools children also learn how to follow  directions, share, and work in groups. Students usually stay in one classroom all day  with one teacher who stays with them throughout the year. Students may leave the  classroom to visit the school library, the school gym, and attend special science, art,  and music classes. Students also usually leave the classroom for lunch and recess.
 For lunch students sit at tables, separated by grade, in a large cafeteria. Recess is  usually a half hour when children go out into a yard to play. The typical school day  starts at about 8:00 in the morning and ends at about 3:00 p.m. Students go to  school from Monday to Friday and have the weekends off.
 Elementary school teachers are licensed by the state where they work. They have  to graduate from college, or even graduate school taking special classes in Early  Childhood and Elementary Education. Before teachers can be in a classroom with  students, they have to pass a background check and take an exam.
27. MIDDLE SCHOOLS IN THE U.S.
 Once a child finishes 5th or 6th grade in elementary school, they graduate and go  on to middle school or junior high school. This school is a separate building or set of  buildings. Most students in middle school are between the ages of 10 and 14. The  grade system continues in middle school. Middle school usually starts with 6th or 7th  grade and ends with 8th grade. While they are less common, some elementary  schools go from kindergarten to 8th grade.
 Most students are assigned a middle school based on where they live. However,  there are charter, private, and specialized public middle schools that have an  application process. The purpose of middle school is to provide a transition period  between elementary school and high school. Middle school prepares students for high  school life. In middle school students don't stay in one classroom all day with one  teacher. Students change classrooms for different subjects and have different  teachers for each subject. In middle school some students may even be able to  choose some of their own classes, called electives. There is a set of core classes that  all students have to take. These include English, math, science, and social studies or  history classes. Gym or physical education classes are also required.
 A common feature of middle school is a homeroom, which is a classroom students  visit at a scheduled time once a day or once a week. A homeroom teacher takes  attendance and makes announcements of things students need to know. The  homeroom also helps students feel like there is one common place and one common  teacher they see regularly. This is to help with the transition from elementary school  to secondary school. Once a student finishes middle school, they have a graduation  ceremony and go to a high school assigned to them or a high school they picked.
28. HIGH SCHOOL IN THE U.S.
 After middle or junior high school, U.S. students go to high school. Going to  school is free in the United States, including high schools. Students do not need to  pay tuitions, and even textbooks and lunches are free. Of course, we are talking  about public schools. If parents choose to send their kids to private schools, they  need to pay very expensive tuitions. High school is the last four years of school that  students in the U.S. are required to attend by law.
 High school students are divided by grades. It begins at 9th grade and finishes  with 12th grade. Some high schools, even public high schools, have admission exams  or an application process. Public schools admit students based on where they live. In  order to successfully complete high school, students have to complete a series of core  classes including math, English, science, history, a foreign language, and gym or  physical education. Students usually can also choose to take electives, or specialized  courses in a subject that interests them. Some high schools in the U.S. have exit  exams that students are required to pass in addition to completing their courses in  order to graduate and earn a high school diploma. A law called the No Child Left  Behind Act requires high schools that get federal money to make students take a  standardized exam every year. A high school diploma is required for students who  want to continue on to college and is considered a minimum requirement for any  jobs.
 High schools classes are designed to prepare students for college. Some high  schools offer specialized skills so that students can find work after graduation without  going to college. Those are called vocational high schools. In high school, some  students have the opportunity to take Advanced Placement (AP) classes. These are  college level classes. If the students pass an exam after taking AP classes, they can  get college credit. In high school, students move from class to class throughout the  school day.
29. HOMESCHOOLING  Not every parent looks forward to the day when their child goes off to school. In  fact some parents are not sending their students to school at all. Instead they are  choosing to teach their children at home. This is called homeschooling. Parents,  caregivers, or private tutors educate children individually at home instead of sending  them off to be formally educated in public or private schools. In the U.S. only about  three percent of children are homeschooled.
 There are many reasons why some parents choose to homeschool. One reason is  that some parents do not feel their children are safe in school because of bullying and  a growing trend of police in school. Other parents want their child's education to be  based on their religion or moral beliefs. Yet other parents feel like the education in  school is not good enough. Homeschooling is also seen as a choice for families that  live in rural areas, and families that travel, like actors.
 There are many different ways to homeschool, and homeschooling allows parents  to customize lessons based on their children's needs. Families can purchase  textbooks to use or create their own materials. Some parents follow a philosophy  called unschooling, which allows a child to determine when, and how they want to  learn based on their natural curiosity. Some worry that homeschooling means  students won't have opportunities to socialize. To answer this concern, some families  have created cooperatives, where a group of homeschooled students will learn and  play together and participate in activities that would normally happen in school like  field trips and prom.
 Being homeschooled doesn't mean a student cannot go to college. Most colleges  accept homeschooled students. It is important, however, for parents and students to  create a portfolio or proof of what has been learned.
30. PARENT-TEACHER CONFERENCES  When parents send their children to school, often they don't know what happens  day to day. Parents rely on what their children tell them about how they are doing  and what they are learning. Generally schools will host parent-teacher conferences at  least twice a year. Parent-teacher conferences are short meetings between parents  and their children's teachers. Usually parent-teacher conferences are held when  teachers give out a student's grades for the term. The parent-teacher conferences  give teachers an opportunity to let parents know how their child is doing. A teacher  will let a parent know the student's strengths and bring to the parent's attention any  problems with grades or behavior. The meetings also offer parents the opportunity to  ask questions and see what their child is learning.
 When it is almost time for parent-teacher conferences, the school will send  parents a note and usually give them an appointment time. There are appointments  during the day and in the evening. Evening appointments are used for parents who  work during the day. Parent-teacher conferences do not last very long. Normally they  do not last longer than 10 minutes. This is why it is important for parents to make  sure they arrive at their appointments on time and come prepared with questions. If  a parent needs more than 10 minutes, he or she should try to schedule another  meeting with the teacher. Keeping a teacher for more than 10 minutes when there  are parents waiting is disrespectful.
 Most children do not go along with their parents to the meetings. This allows both  the parent and teacher to talk honestly about the child's progress without making the  child feel bad. Usually a teacher will offer advice to the parent on how to support  their child's education.
31. PRIVATE SCHOOLS - AN EXPENSIVE EDUCATIONAL  ALTERNATIVE  Public schools are available for kids from kindergarten through 12th grade free of  charge. However, many families choose to pay for their children's primary and  secondary education by sending them to private schools. There are many different  types of private schools and many different reasons why parents send their kids  there. Some private schools are military type and yet others are boarding schools  where students live on campus. Some private schools are affiliated with a certain  religion. These schools teach a specific faith's beliefs and traditions as well as the  regular academic subjects. There are schools run by Catholics, Protestants, Jewish  people, Muslims, and Orthodox Christians. There are also private schools that  specialize in teaching disabled students.
 Some parents choose private schools because they feel that they offer a better  education than public schools; others choose private schools because they offer a  different type of curriculum. Waldorf Schools, for example, only let children play and  use items made of natural materials.
 Private schools are also called independent schools or non-state schools because  they are not run by local, state, or national governments. They can pick what  students to go to their schools. They do this through admission examinations and  interviews. There is often an admissions application. Some private schools accept  anyone who can pay tuition to send their children there. Some schools charge up to  $45,000 a year. Private schools charge tuition because they do not get any money  collected from local, state, and national taxes. Some private schools offer a limited  number of scholarships to help pay for school. Many of these scholarships are need based, meaning for students who can't afford the tuition. Other scholarships are  offered for students with very good grades or for students that have a talent in a  sport or art.
32. THE CALIFORNIA COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY SYSTEM  California is the largest state in the United States of America. It is home to more  than 10 percent of the country's total population. It also has the largest education  system in the country. The college and university system is divided into four parts.
 Those parts are the University of California system, the California State University  system, the community college system, and private institutions.
 The UC system has more than 230,000 students at its 10 Campuses. It is  considered the more prestigious system in the state. It includes top universities like  UC Berkeley, and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Both schools rank  in the top 25 universities in the country, with Berkeley in the top 10. A degree from  the UC system is highly sought, and the academic standards are higher than the  other systems. They are also more expensive.
 The California State Universities counts 23 universities in its system. It is a  diversified system that includes two polytechnic universities, and a maritime  university. These schools offer vocational and maritime education, but also offer  traditional, academic programs. The systems enrollment is approximately 450,000  students, with about 45,000 faculty members.
 The California Community Colleges system is the largest systems of higher  education in the state, and the world. It boasts 112 campuses, and serves  approximately 2.4 million students. It offers transfer degrees, vocational training, and  associates degree programs.
 California is also home to a large number of privately owned and operated  schools. These schools have no ties to the state school system, but some do accept  transfer students from community colleges. The most notable and prestigious schools  in the state are Stanford University, in Palo Alto, and the University of Southern  California, in Los Angeles.
33. DRIVING IN THE UNITED STATES  Driving in the U.S. can be confusing not just because of all the rules and laws that  drivers must follow, but also because of driving customs. Many people in the U.S. are  really dependent on their cars to get to work and school. In fact most American  workers spend an hour driving to work each day. In order to drive in the U.S., you  have to go to your local Department of Motor Vehicles first, and take a written test to  get your learner's permit. If you pass this test, you can practice driving so you can  pass a road test and get your license. The Department of Motor Vehicles or DMV has  free booklets you can go and get to study for your learner's permit. You can also  access the information online and even take a practice written exam. To prepare for  the road test, you can have a friend teach you to drive or pay to take classes at a  driving school. You cannot, however, practice driving by yourself. If you are caught  driving with only a learner's permit, you can get into trouble with the law.
 Once you get your driver's license in one state, you can use it to drive in all of the  United States. Wherever you drive, you will see signs posted along the road  indicating the speed limit. These numbers are not a suggestion. Generally you can  drive faster on a highway than on local streets. Local police use special equipment to  detect your speed. If they detect you are speeding or driving over the speed limit,  police can stop you and give you a ticket. You will have to pay a fine, and some of the  fines are more than $100. The lines painted on the road are not just to keep cars in  their lanes. They send a message. For example, a double solid yellow line means that  it is against the law to pass another car here.
34. PASADENA ROSE PARADE  Each New Year's Day, the city of Pasadena in California hosts a celebration to  welcome the year with a series of events that includes the Rose Parade. The parade  takes place in the center of the city on Colorado Blvd, and features numerous floats,  marching bands, equestrian teams, celebrities, and honorees. It is the most popular  parade in the country. It has spawned several other New Year's Day parades  throughout the country. In Miami, it's the Orange Bowl Parade; in New Orleans, it is  the Sugar Bowl Parade; in Arizona, it's called the Fiesta Bowl Parade. However, the  Rose Parade is the oldest and best parade. Many people like to camp out in tents or  in sleeping bags the night before to get the best locations to view the Rose Parade.
 To brave the cold weather, some people bring portable heaters to keep them  warm. It can get into the low 40s at night in Pasadena during the winter, so many  people dress warm for the occasion. Food is another big feature at the pre-parade  celebration on New Year's Eve. People bring their portable grills to cook their favorite  outdoor meals right on the sidewalk. The rich aroma of the grilling food fills the night  air, and most people are willing to share their food with other overnight campers. It is  fun to sample different dishes from other grillers.
 As night turns into morning, there is still electricity in the air. People are excited  about the start of the parade, which begins at 8 a.m. sharp. The floats are beautifully  decorated in flowers, while the dancers and other performers dress in colorful  costumes, some of which are made just for the parade. The marching bands come  from nearby cities, high schools, and colleges. It is considered a great honor to  participate in the Rose Parade.
35. SELFIES  The self-portrait is nothing new. Painters and photographers have always used  themselves as subjects. Today, however, almost everyone walks around with a  camera in his or her pocket. This is because most cell phones have cameras on them.
 The fact that most people have cell phone cameras with them all the time has led to  the rise of the selfie. A selfie is a self-portrait usually taken with a cell phone.
 Since the pictures are usually taken on a cell phone, many people tend to share  these photographs with friends and even strangers on different social networking  websites. Some of the popular social networking platforms people use to share selfies  include Instagram, Snapchat, and Facebook.
 People usually take selfies when they are engaged in normal day-to-day activities.
 They take selfies of their commutes to work or school. People take selfies of  themselves eating. Other people take selfies to show what they are wearing or whom  they are hanging out with.
 The most common way to take a selfie is by holding a cell phone at arm's length.
 Some people take selfies by taking a picture of their reflection in a mirror. In these  pictures, you can usually see the phone the person is taking a picture with. Selfies  taken using a mirror often are taken in a bathroom, which some people think is  offensive. The bathroom is a very private place, not a place to take pictures.
 Some people think that selfies are a sign that people are becoming vain or  superficial. It is not often that people take pictures of themselves that make them  look bad. When people take pictures of themselves, they usually are trying to present  themselves in the best light. However, some people use selfies to show what they  really look like. Some people are trying to challenge stereotypes of what makes  someone attractive.
36. APARTMENT PETS  In U.S. cities like New York City and Los Angeles, many people live in small  apartments. Despite not having homes with big yards, some apartment dwellers still  seek the companionship that domesticated animals like dogs and cats offer. Some  people feel that having a pet, even in a small space, is good for teaching children  responsibility.
 However, many landlords forbid tenants from having pets, specifically cats and  dogs, because of the damage the animals can do to carpets. Some landlords even  forbid birds because of the noise they make. Many landlords charge an extra fee,  known as a pet deposit, to tenants who want to keep pets. This is to pay for repairs  or cleaning caused by the pet.
 Many times apartment dwellers will choose animals, like fish, hermit crabs, guinea  pigs or hamsters, that make little noise, little mess, and won't chew up the furniture.
 Other people keep lizards as pets, since they don't require much space and can be  kept in small cages or tanks. Another benefit of these smaller pets is that they don't  need to be walked. However, some people who live in apartments have pets that are  not so ordinary. Some of these less than ordinary pets include mammals like  hedgehogs, amphibians like frogs, and spiders like tarantulas. Not all exotic pets are  legal though.
 In order to maintain public safety, some cities and states have laws banning  specific animals as pets. New York City, for example, bans people from keeping  ferrets, snapping turtles, pythons, and scorpions as pets. It seems unlikely that a  family would have a polar bear named Fluffy or a whale named Bubbles as a pet, New  York City has specific laws banning these wild animals from residences. These laws  exist for a good reason. In 2003, a man in a Manhattan apartment was discovered to  have a 350-pound Bengal tiger as a pet.
37. NON-TRADITIONAL WAKES  A wake is when people go to a deceased person's home or a funeral parlor to pay  their last respects. A funeral parlor is a place where the preparation of the corpse for  burial takes place. Part of the preparation can be dressing the deceased, doing their  makeup, and placing them in a coffin for people to see. Some people do have a  closed casket wake, where you can't see the dead person; some people are not even  choosing coffins for their dearly departed loved ones.
 In the United States, more and more families are choosing not to have traditional  wakes. There is a recent trend of people having non-traditional wakes with the  deceased person posed doing something they loved doing when they were alive. For  example, a family in New Orleans had their dead loved one posed at a table with a  cigarette between her fingers and a can of beer. One funeral home in Puerto Rico has  become famous for its non-traditional wakes. It all started in 2008, when a family  asked for their dead loved one to be propped up against the wall of their home for  the wake. When a paramedic died, his family had his dead body in the driver's seat of  an ambulance. Another family had a man propped up in a fake boxing ring for his  wake. One dead man was posed on top of his motorcycle. Recently, a grandmother  was posed sitting in her rocking chair.
 These non-traditional wakes have their critics though. Some people think they are  disrespectful. They think of death as a solemn and sad occasion, not a time to pose  the dead as if they were toys. Fans feel it helps them remember the dead as they  were when they were alive.
38. HOMELESSNESS IN LOS ANGELES  It is very common to see homeless people on the streets of Los Angeles. This is a  problem that has persisted in the city since the beginning of the 20th century. Back in  that time, California was known for offering many job opportunities in farming, and  many young men were hopping on trains from all over the country to arrive in Los  Angeles. Unfortunately, many of those men often ended up finding themselves  without a job, a place to stay, or even food to eat. To help these people, many  churches began to establish shelters in the area of Los Angeles that would eventually  become Downtown. Even as the farm landscape changed to a big city environment,  these shelters remained a refuge for many individuals that found themselves  homeless  Nowadays, the homeless population of Los Angeles is made up of much more than  just young men looking for work. Many economic and social changes have resulted in  both men and women of all ages turning to the streets of Los Angeles. Some of them  are there as a result of substance abuse that has left them moneyless and jobless.
 Others are veterans from various wars that cannot find the resources to get back to  their normal lives. Additionally, many of these people suffer from mental disabilities  that limit them from finding a job or being accepted in the rest of society.
 Since there are a lot of different causes that lead to homelessness, it is easy to  see why finding solutions to helping all of the homeless people is so difficult. Although  there are many programs that focus on providing the homeless food daily, it is much  harder to find programs that try to assist the homeless in finding jobs, and stable  housing. In order to finally find a solution that will effectively help decrease the  number of homeless people in the city, a lot more individualized attention must be  placed on individuals based on their physical and mental health, and circumstance.
39. PARAMEDICS  Some of the everyday heroes in the United States are the country's paramedics.
 These young men and women are usually the first people who respond to medical  emergencies suffered by citizens. Paramedics must complete a very extensive  physical training program that is designed to weed out those who cannot make the  cut. A paramedic must be in fit condition, and be mentally strong to perform his or  her duties in the face of danger. Many of these heroes must endure life-threatening  situations when responding to emergencies. Paramedics are usually attached to a  county, or city fire department, but there are also some private paramedic  organizations.
 In Southern California, there are two primary schools for paramedic training. They  are UCLA's Daniel Freeman Paramedic program and the Paramedic Training Institute.
 Both of these schools provide candidates for the Los Angeles County and City Fire  Departments. To become a paramedic for a county or city organization, candidates  must also pass a psychological screening and a physical training program.
 Some of the equipment paramedics carry is very specialized. They carry basic and  advanced life support gear such as forcible entry tools so they can reach people in  peril, saws to cut through obstacles, and other emergency equipment. Paramedics  provide a valuable service to the communities they serve. They must be certified in  Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) techniques, and be trained to handle all  situations.
 Some paramedics are trained to respond to what is called Mass Casualty Incidents  (MCI). These emergencies occur whenever there is a tragic event such as the  September 11, 2001 attacks on the country, and other emergencies like earthquakes,  mudslides, or floods. Paramedics can also be sent to emergency situations by citizens  who call the 911 emergency phone number.
40. SEPTEMBER 11TH  One of the darkest days in American history was September 11, 2001. This is "a  day that will live in infamy" for most Americans. It was the most tragic day in the  history of the country since December 7, 1941 when the Japanese attacked Pearl  Harbor. September 11th was the day Muslim extremists hijacked four commercial  airliners in an attempt to destroy the American spirit by slamming those jets into four  buildings. Three of the four jets reached their targets, while one was stopped by a  group of everyday heroes who gave their lives for their country.
 In the early morning hours on September 11, 2001, American Airlines Flight 11  slammed into the north tower of the World Trade Center in New York City. A few  minutes later, Flight 175, also an American Airlines flight, struck the south tower.
 Both suicide attacks brought the towers down, but not immediately. It took time for  the extreme heat from the burning jet fuel to weaken the towers to their eventual  collapse. At about the same time, American Airlines, Flight 77 crashed into the  Pentagon, which is a government building in the country's capitol, Washington D.C.
 The fourth flight, United Airlines Flight 93, was also headed for the capitol city.
 Most people think its target was either the capitol building, or the White House, the  president's home. A group of brave passengers, upon hearing the news of what was  happening in the country, decided to take down the giant airplane even though they  knew they would not survive. They stormed the cockpit and took the controls from  the hijackers. The plane flew out of control, crashing into a field in the state of  Pennsylvania, where all passengers were killed.
 In all, about 3,000 Americans lost their lives on that day, but the American spirit  was not suppressed. Those responsible for the attacks were quickly dealt with, and  the country soon began its journey to recovery. September 11, 2001, a day America  will never forget.
41. THE CALIFORNIA REDWOODS AND GIANT SEQUOIAS  Some of the most majestic landscape views in California are the great California  Redwood and Sequoia trees. These trees can be seen up close at Sequoia National  Park in the southern Sierra Nevada mountain range, of Visalia. This central California  region boasts more than 400,000 acres of natural beauty that is uniquely Californian.
 The park is known as the Land of the Giants because of its beautiful trees. The  landscape features great mountains, foothills, deep canyons, a large cavern system,  and, of course, the world's largest trees.
 The park sits side by side with King's Canyon National Park in the stunning San  Joaquin Valley. Sequoia National Park was officially established as a national park in  the 1890s. It features 14 campsites that include picnic tables, fire rings for outdoor  cooking, and food storage boxes. It is a great place for a family vacation with many  of its campsites open year round. But the most popular attractions are its forests.
 The ancient trees are some of the oldest living organisms on earth, and draw millions  of visitors worldwide. Redwood trees can reach heights of more than 375 feet. They  are closely related to the Giant Sequoia trees, and are often mistaken for each other.
 They both are uniquely Californian, as they do not grow naturally in any other region  in the world.
 Redwood trees live up to 2,000 years, and have branches that grow up to five feet  in diameter. Its bark can grow up to 12 inches thick. The Giant Sequoia trees can live  up to an astonishing 3,000 years, and have branches up to eight feet in diameter. Its  bark can grow to an amazing thickness of three feet. Both trees have dark brown  bark, and look very similar, but the Redwood thrives in coastal climate, while the  Sequoia exists in more mountainous areas. In either case, they are a must-see  California attraction.
42. THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL  There are many law enforcement agencies in the United States, and especially in  California. Some of the largest agencies in Southern California are the Los Angeles  Police Department, and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. Both of these  police forces are some of the largest in the country. They handle a full-range of police  duties ranging from traffic citations to murder, rape, and robbery cases. There are  also a number of smaller police agencies operating side by side with the LAPD and  L.A. County Sheriff's Department. Cities, such as Monterey Park, have their own  police force, while smaller cities depend on the Sheriff's Department for their law  enforcement needs. Because of the unique nature of the state, California created the  California Highway Patrol.
 The CHP, as it is usually called, is a police agency that is entrusted with patrolling  the vast number of freeway miles that exist in California. The state was built during a  time of great mobility after the advent of the personal vehicle. Because of this, the  state has more freeway miles than any other states in the United States with the  exception of Texas. However, California has the most licensed drivers, and by far, the  most registered vehicles. This made it necessary to create a police force dedicated to  its highways.
 CHP officers are endowed with the same powers other police officers have.
 However, they do not have a crime investigation team for any offense other than  traffic-related crimes. Whenever the CHP first responds to a crime that is not traffic related, its officers perform the same duties a regular officer does. It then turns  investigations over to the LAPD, or Sheriff's office depending on the location of the  crime. The CHP has a long, and storied history. Many young Californians, both male  and female, are attracted to the CHP, and enroll into its academy in Sacramento, the  state's capital.
43. THE GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE  One of the most beautiful, and recognizable California landmarks is the Golden  Gate Bridge in the city of San Francisco. The bridge spans the San Francisco Bay, and  is part of a network of five main bridges that cross the bay in the San Francisco and  Oakland area. The region with its bay has one of the most breathtaking views in the  world, and part of which is the historic Golden Gate Bridge.
 It is perhaps the most iconic and recognizable landmark in the entire United  States. Construction on the bridge began in 1933, while the country was deeply  mired in the Great Depression. Many people think the bridge was, in large part,  responsible for the country's economic recovery because of the number of workers  employed. The material used to build the bridge also contributed to the  manufacturing, distribution, and transportation.
 The bridge connects San Francisco to the San Francisco peninsula in Marin County  through both California State Route 1, and U.S. Route 101. Before the bridge was  built, the only way to get from one location to the other was to go around the bay, or  to take a ferry across. Construction of the bridge was controversial at the time. Many  thought the project was simply too complex, expensive, and dangerous to build. The  construction plan approved concentrated on safety for the workers who would be  involved in the construction, and it worked well until February 17, 1937. Remarkably,  only one worker had died up to that date, but on that date, a scaffolding collapsed  killing 10 men in the tragic accident.
 The bridge was completed later that year, and has been in use ever since. It is  one of California's great landmarks with people from all over the world drawn to see  it.
44.THE SAN FRANCISCO CABLE CARS  One of the most historic, and significant landmarks in the United States is the San  Francisco cable car system. It is the world's only, manually operated cable car  system. It is run by the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency. The system  dates back to 1878, when the California Street line first opened. In all, there are  three lines currently operating in the city, and boasts a fleet of 12 cable cars. There  used to be 23 lines in use throughout the city connecting the diverse communities  that make up San Francisco. The open-air cars are a major tourist attraction, and are  still used by San Francisco commuters on a daily basis.
 The simple reason cable cars were first used in the city was because of its  landscape. San Francisco is very hilly, which makes it impossible for municipal buses  to scale. The solution for this problem was the cable car. These cars are literally  pulled by cable, up and down the steep hills of the city, making it easier for people to  get from one end of the city to the other.
 There are two types of cars in use today. Single-ended cars and double-ended  cars. The single-ended cars have open-sided sections with seats that face outward to  the street. The rear section of these cars is enclosed with seats facing the interior of  the car. These cars seat 29 passengers. They travel in both directions by using a  swivel-based turntable that turns the car at the end of the line. The double-ended  cars are a bit larger, and can hold up to 68 passengers. It has 34 seats, and grips for  an additional 34 standing passengers. The best feature of these cars is the pure fun  they are to ride. People who ride the San Francisco cable cars are stepping into part  of California's history.
45. CAR CHASE TELEVISION  Car chases in the Los Angeles area are a fairly regular occurrence. In 2013 there  were over 700 car chases. Car chases also have become a source of entertainment.
 Many car chases are captured on video and broadcast live as they are happening. No  one has to wait until the six o'clock news comes on anymore to find out about what  happened. People can tune in to their local broadcast television station and see it  happening in real time. These car chases are often captured with the help of a news  channel's helicopter. The helicopter follows and films the chase through the streets,  reporting what streets the cars are passing through.
 People like watching car chases for many reasons. They are intense, and filled  with drama. A viewer never knows what will happen next. Will the driver give up  easily? Does the driver have a weapon? Will the driver get into an accident? Will  someone crossing the street get hit? Tune in to find out! Many channels see their  ratings soar when they air car chases. They are just giving the people what they  want.
 Police are not always happy with the media covering car chases live on the air.
 Police worry that people trying to escape enjoy the attention. Police feel that  broadcasting car chases encourages people to escape. Police also worry that the  attention brings innocent bystanders to the street. Someone could get hurt. The  media insists they have the right to show car chases. They feel they are informing  the public.
 Car chases happen for many reasons. Sometimes police will chase someone who  stole a car. Other times the police may try to do a routine traffic stop. However, the  driver with the broken taillight may have a warrant for arrest, so off he drives.
46. LOS ANGELES CORONER'S OFFICE  In Los Angeles, places associated with death are often popular. One such popular  place is the Department of Medical Examiner-Coroner. When someone dies and the  cause of death is undetermined or suspicious, the body is brought here for  examination. It is the coroner's job to determine the time, cause, and manner of  death. Sometimes the coroner will have to perform an autopsy, which is like an  operation on a dead body to try to figure out how the person died. One of the  reasons the L.A. Coroner's Office is so popular is because of the number of famous  people who have been examined there. Some of those people include Marilyn  Monroe, Robert F. Kennedy, Michael Jackson, and Whitney Houston.
 The Los Angeles Coroner's Office is so popular that there is even a gift shop where  visitors can buy items like shirts, caps, and mugs with the Coroner's logo on them.
 One tee-shirt people can buy even says, "Our bodies of work speak for themselves".
 They even sell beach towels with body outlines. The store is open five days a week.
 They also have a website and a paper catalog for those who are not close enough to  visit. The Coroner's Office claims the purpose of the store is to tell people how fragile  life is and to create awareness and responsibility toward one's actions. Some people  feel that having a store in the same place where dead people are is disrespectful.
 There have been a number of television shows about the L.A. Coroner's Office.
 Some of these are reality TV shows featuring what workers really do there. An  example is called "Death Detectives". Other shows are fictional like "Quincy M.E." The  M.E. stands for medical examiner, the person who performs the autopsies.
47. MUSEUM MILE IN NEW YORK CITY  On one of New York City's most famous avenues, Fifth Avenue, is Museum Mile.
 Museum Mile is a 23-block stretch that holds some of the most famous museums in  the world. Museum Mile begins at 85th Street and Fifth Avenue with the massive  Metropolitan Museum of Art. Inside is thousands of years worth of art and artifacts. A  visitor can visit an entire Egyptian tomb, sit in a Japanese style garden, view  Renaissance paintings, and ancient Greek and Roman sculptures. There is even a  gallery featuring musical instruments. In the summer, there is a rooftop garden  where there are spectacular views of the city, especially of Central Park.
 The Guggenheim, on 88th Street and Fifth Avenue, looks a little bit like a snail's  shell from the outside. When it opened in the 1950's, the swirling architecture,  designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, was thought to be ugly by many. This museum  focuses on modern art, but sometimes features special exhibits like one they had a  few years ago of ancient Mexican ruins. The National Academy Museum and School of  Fine Arts on 91st Street and Fifth Avenue is the city's oldest art school, dating back  to 1825. The Jewish Museum on 93rd Street and Fifth Avenue, tells 4,000 years  worth of Jewish History. Up ten blocks on 103rd Street and Fifth Avenue is the  Museum of the City of New York, showcasing the history of the Big Apple from its  colonial start.
 One block up on 104th Street and Fifth Avenue is El Museo del Barrio. This  museum started as a space to reflect the city's large Puerto Rican migrant  community. Now it features exhibits focusing on art from all over Latin America.
 Across the avenue is the Central Park Conservatory Garden, with a fountain that has  a sculpture of three dancing life-size women.
48. A BUILDING FOR THE EMPIRE STATE  The Empire State Building may be the most famous building in New York City. It is  called the Empire State Building because New York State is called the Empire State. It  is 1,454 feet tall. Many people think it is the tallest building in the world. This was  true when it was built in 1931. In 1970, when the World Trade Center was built, that  became the tallest building. Now, the Empire State Building is the fourth tallest  building in the U.S. and the 23rd tallest in the world. Inside the building is mostly  occupied by offices and stores.
 People can go to the top of the building, where there is an observation deck. From  the top there are beautiful views of New York City, especially at night. Most people  take one of 73 elevators to the top. It takes less than one minute by elevator to get  to the 80th floor. That is where there is a gift shop. Some people walk 1,860 steps to  the top. Every year there is even a race, with people competing to see who can walk  up to the top the fastest.
 The landmark is not just famous because of its height. In 1945, a small plane  crashed into it. More than 30 people have tried to kill themselves by jumping off the  building. In 1933 it was featured in the movie King Kong, where a giant gorilla climbs  to the top and falls to his death after being attacked by airplanes. The building was  also in the movie Sleepless in Seattle with Tom Hanks.
 At night, the top of the Empire State Building is lit up in different colors. It is red  and green on Christmas, red for Lunar New Year, and blue for Hanukkah. On the  Fourth of July it is red, white, and blue.
49. THE STATUE OF LIBERTY ENLIGHTENING THE WORLD  Most people don't know that the full name of the Statue of Liberty is "The Statue  of Liberty Enlightening the World". She is a symbol of freedom, especially for many  immigrants. When many immigrants came to the United States in the late 1800s,  Lady Liberty in New York Harbor was a sign to tell them that they had made it to  America. Inside the base of the statue there is a plaque with a famous poem written  on it. The poem is "The New Colossus" by Emma Lazarus. Many immigrants feel this  poem speaks to them the reasons they came to America. One line of the poem is:  "Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free". Lady  Liberty was not always green. She used to be copper colored, but the years have  caused the copper that the statue is made of to change color.
 The 151-foot tall sculpture was a 100th birthday gift from France to the United  States in 1886. It is located on Liberty Island right off the southern tip of Manhattan,  New York City. The only way to get there is to take a ferry. Inside the base of the  statue is a museum. To get to the crown, people have to climb 377 steps up a double  spiral staircase from the feet of the statue. There is no elevator. People need to be in  good shape to climb to the top. People used to be able to climb up to the torch of the  statue, but it was shut down because it was too easy to fall off.
 About four million people visit the Statue of Liberty every year. People who can't  go to New York can see replicas in Las Vegas and other parts of the world.
50. ROCKEFELLER CENTER - TOP OF THE ROCK  Rockefeller Center is a complex of 19 buildings. It is named for a famous New  York City business magnate, John D. Rockefeller, who built the group of buildings  from 1930-1939. The most famous building in the complex is the General Electric  building where NBC television studios are based. It is smack in the middle of  Manhattan, New York City, between Fifth and Sixth Avenues and between 48th and  51st Streets. The address of the GE building is 30 Rockefeller Plaza. That's how the  show "30 Rock" got its name. The show was filmed there. Saturday Night Live, a  popular American late night show, is also filmed there. Visitors can get tickets to see  a show being taped and can also tour the studios.
 Visitors to Rockefeller Center can visit the plaza, which becomes an ice skating  rink in the winter. Every year a huge Christmas tree is placed there and thousands of  people attend the tree lighting ceremony, which always features famous singers. In  the spring, summer, and fall, the plaza becomes a cafe. In the middle of the plaza is  a statue of the Greek god Prometheus. His myth states that he brought fire to the  world. 200 flags from all countries of the United Nations surround the plaza.
 Radio City Music Hall is another famous building in Rockefeller Center. Many  musicians give concerts here, but it is best known as the home of the Rockettes, a  dance company named for Rockefeller Center. They are famous for their kick lines  and are best known for performing in the Radio City Christmas Spectacular, an annual  musical holiday stage show.
51. MANHATTAN, NEW YORK CITY  Manhattan is a small island that is one part of New York City. New York City, "the  Big Apple", is actually made up of five sections called boroughs. These boroughs are  Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn, Staten Island, and the Bronx. Manhattan has the most  people of all the boroughs, about 1.5 million, even though it is the smallest borough  by size. If you send a letter to someone who lives on Manhattan, don't write  Manhattan on the envelope. You should write "New York, New York", like the famous  Frank Sinatra song.
 Because the island is so small, most people live and work in tall buildings. Some  of these buildings are called skyscrapers because it looks like they are touching the  sky. Some famous skyscrapers in Manhattan are Empire State Building, Chrysler  Building, 70 Pine Street, Trump Building, GE Building, and Citigroup Center.
 Manhattan is connected to the other boroughs by a series of bridges and tunnels. The  most famous bridge may be the Brooklyn Bridge because of its brick arches. The New  York City subway, a massive mass transit system that mostly runs underground, also  connects the island to the rest of the boroughs.
 Manhattan, like the other boroughs, has many different neighborhoods, many of  which are named for the ethnic communities that first lived there. Some of these  neighborhoods include Little Italy, Little Germany, Little Brazil, Chinatown, and  Koreatown. One of the most famous parts of Manhattan is Times Square. Times  Square is called the crossroads of the world. Every year millions of people gather  there on New Year's Eve to watch an illuminated crystal ball drop. There are many  theaters around Times Square. Most of these theaters are on Broadway, a famous  street considered the home of the American theater industry. Another famous  Manhattan street is Fifth Avenue. A part of the avenue features expensive designer  stores like Tiffany's. Fifth Avenue is also famous for its Museum Mile.
52. LAS VEGAS, NEVADA  For many years, gambling in the United States was legal only in the state of  Nevada. Nevada is a western state that is east of California, south of Oregon and  Idaho, west of Utah, and north of Arizona. It is a desert state where little rain falls  during the year. It is a little more than 275 miles from the city of Los Angeles, which  is where most of its visitors come from. Driving from Los Angeles is about four hours.
 Las Vegas, which means the Meadows in Spanish, was established by the Mexicans in  the mid-1800s. Much of what is now the southwestern part of the United States was  then part of the Mexican Empire. The city was a railroad town established in 1905,  and the first legal casino appeared in 1931.
 Las Vegas is now a gambling town, where people from all over the United States  come to vacation. Its population is under 2,000,000, making it the 30th largest city  in the country. Its original population in 1905 was only 5,000. Much of the city's  growth is due to the gambling industry. Many states have since legalized gambling,  including New Jersey, and California, but Las Vegas remains the No. 1 tourist city for  gamblers in the U.S. Today some of its largest and most beautiful hotels include  Bellagio, Flamingo, Caesars Palace, Treasure Island, Mandalay Bay, and Wynn. These  hotels are on Las Vegas Boulevard, which is commonly called "The Strip." With its  nearly year-round sunshine, beautiful casinos, and variety of gaming options, Las  Vegas remains the best location for gambling in the U.S.
53. MR. ROGERS' NEIGHBORHOOD  Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood was one of the most successful and well-liked children's  show in the history of Public Television. Public TV differs from the more common  commercial television in that it is not funded by advertising revenue. Public Television  is a network of television stations throughout the country that is dedicated to  bringing alternative programming to the people of the United States.
 Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood ran from February 1968 through August 2001, and was  hosted by the show's namesake, Fred Rogers. It was a half-hour children's show that  featured the popular Rogers as host. It is often referred to as the Mr. Rogers show.
 Rogers began his show in 1953 on a PBS station in the northeast part of the  country as the Children's Corner. He performed as a puppeteer, and it was aired on  live television. There Rogers developed many of the characters that would become  famous as his show progressed. In 1967, his show went on the national TV stage,  and remained there until 2001.
 Rogers' style and calm demeanor made him an instant celebrity who was well liked by both children and adults. In his early life, Rogers studied to become a  Presbyterian minister, but didn't like how children's programming was being  presented. He began writing children's songs, and soon began his own local show on  public television. During the next three decades, Rogers became a true American icon  through his show. His great compassion, morality, and patience were possibly his  most liked characteristics.
 Rogers was not only a great TV personality, he was also a human rights advocate.
 He received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, as well as the Peabody Award for  meritorious public service. Rogers was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame, and  has received approximately 40 honorary degrees.
54. THE CINCO DE MAYO CELEBRATION  The Cinco de Mayo, or Fifth of May, is a holiday celebrated by Mexicans in the  United States. Before 1776, much of the southern and western states, such as Texas,  New Mexico, Colorado, Nevada, Arizona, and California were part of Mexico. Following  the war between the U.S. and Mexico in the 1800s, these states became part of the  United States, but there still remained a very large Mexican population.
 The Latino population is the largest, single ethnic group in the country. It  accounts for 17 percent of the nation's population, and 63 percent of those Latinos  are of Mexican origins. The Cinco de Mayo is a large celebration in the country's  southwest region. It celebrates the Mexican victory in the Battle of Puebla, against  France on May 5, 1862. Curiously, the day is celebrated more in the United States  than it is in Mexico itself.
 In Los Angeles, the city celebrates the event with the Fiesta Broadway, which is  the largest Cinco de Mayo celebration in the world. More than half a million people  come to downtown L.A. to participate in the street fair that covers 24 square blocks.
 The celebration takes place on the last Sunday of April. There are rides, games, and  especially food at this celebration and it is growing every year. Los Angeles is not the  only Southland city to host Cinco de Mayo celebrations. The cities of Corona, West  Los Angeles, and Commerce also have events, and the famous Olvera Street  celebration in downtown L.A. is also very popular.
 One of the most unique Cinco de Mayo events takes place in the Hancock Park  district of Los Angeles. It is called the Single de Mayo. This celebration is an annual  charity event that began in 1999. It is a private party that benefits the homeless by  providing shelter and support. Cinco de Mayo is a truly American celebration.
55. THE ATTACK ON PEARL HARBOR  On December 7, 1941, the United States of America was attacked by the Imperial  Japanese Navy at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. The surprise attack was intended to destroy  the American Pacific Fleet that stood in the way of Japan's complete domination of  the Pacific Ocean during the 1940s. The attack was coordinated with attacks in the  Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, and Hong Kong. Pearl Harbor was attacked by more  than 350 Japanese airplane fighters, bombers and torpedo planes that were launched  from six aircraft carriers.
 The early-morning attack sank four U.S. battleships, and four more were heavily  damaged. Six of the eight battleships were restored, and returned to service, but the  Japanese also destroyed, or damaged three cruisers, three destroyers, a minelayer,  and an anti-aircraft training ship. In addition, 188 U.S. aircraft were destroyed, with  many of them on the ground. The attack was devastating. It took the U.S. years to  recover from all the damage caused on that fateful morning. However, the Japanese  were unable to destroy their main targets, the Navy's aircraft carriers. By what some  call a stroke of luck, the U.S. carrier fleet was out to sea at the time of the attack.
 The country was in shock at the news of the disaster. U.S. President Franklin  Delano Roosevelt called the attack cowardly, and declared December 7th as "A day  that will live in infamy." On December 8, the United States formally declared war on  Japan. This plummeted the country into World War II, which Roosevelt had long  hoped to avoid. Soon after the United States' declaration of war against Japan,  Germany, which was a Japanese ally, declared war on the U.S. and the country was  now fully involved in the greatest war in the history of the world.
56. FUNERAL CUSTOMS IN THE UNITED STATES  America is one of the most diversified countries in the world. It is comprised of  many different cultures from Latin America, Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is truly a  melting pot of diversity. All these cultures have come together to create a new culture- an American culture. Many of the traditions, customs, religions, and celebrations of  these cultures have been adopted into American culture, including funeral traditions.
 Traditional American funerals are basic. They usually include some sort of religious  ritual, followed by a procession to the burial grounds, and a small ceremony at the  grave site, but these vary depending on the culture. At most American funerals, the  deceased person's family sends out a death announcement called an obituary. These  obits normally serve to pass information to others about the deceased, and the time  and day of the funeral event. At the church service, the deceased is usually eulogized  by friends and family. This is where a person goes up to the front of the crowd to say  a few things about the deceased, and how he or she affected their life. The  procession usually takes the form of a caravan of private cars, and trucks that follow  the hearse, which contains the deceased's coffin, and remains.
 At the gravesite, another small ritual takes place where the deceased is given a  blessing from a member of the clergy. Friends and family are then allowed to say  goodbye to the deceased. There is an American tradition of picking up a handful of  soil, and tossing it on the coffin as a way of saying farewell to the deceased. The  family then gathers at a home, or restaurant with some of the attendees to have a  meal, and to exchange stories before going on their way. Most cultures in the U.S.
 have adopted this traditional American funeral ritual, but many include features that  are unique to their individual culture.
57. THE JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION  One of the most significant dates in the history of the United States is November  22, 1963. That is the day President John Fitzgerald Kennedy was assassinated in  Dallas, Texas while riding in an open-air car. The president was visiting Texas for the  first time since his inauguration in January, 1961. Kennedy was one of the most  popular presidents in the history of the United States, and still remains so today. His  death shocked the nation for several reasons, but mostly because it was televised on  a live broadcast. Kennedy was the first president to appear on television at a time  when most Americans owned a TV. He was not the first president to be televised, but  previous presidents who appeared on TV did not reach the general public because  before 1960, not many Americans owned a set.
 Kennedy was warned not to ride in an open-air car that day by his bodyguards,  but he wanted the public to see him live. He did not want to be hidden behind an  armored car. According to the official government commission, Kennedy fell victim to  a single assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald, but many Americans dispute that finding to  this date. Police say Oswald shot the president from a building while Kennedy rode in  his car with his wife. The mood was festive at the time as the city of Dallas welcomed  the president to Texas. Kennedy was a handsome, young president who was the  youngest man ever to reach the presidency.
 Oswald later killed a Dallas police officer during his escape from the crime scene,  but was soon found hiding in a movie theater. He required police protection from an  outraged public, and was held in protective custody. Oswald, who was a former  member of the U.S. military, was unhappy with the president for his policies, but  never admitted to being the assassin. Conspiracy theories involving rival political  parties, the Cuban government, and organized crime have also been advanced as to  who actually killed Kennedy.
58. SOCIAL CLASS IN THE UNITED STATES  Generally people's "class" is defined by how much money they make. In the U.S.
 generally there are three classes: poor, middle class, and rich. Some people also  think there is another class in between poor and middle class called working class.
 United States culture is based on the idea that people can move up the economic  ladder and become middle class or even rich if they were born poor. This is the idea  of going from "rags to riches". Moving up the class ladder is not easy though. Higher  education needed to get a good paying job is expensive.
 Class in the United States is more than just how much money a person makes  though. Education, what job a person has, where they live, and the culture, all play a  role in what class a person will be classified as. For example, a person with only a  high school diploma and a low-paying service job may be considered poor or low  class. While a person with a Ph.D., who owns their own company, would be  considered high class or wealthy. In a way this makes sense because high-paying  jobs usually require a high-level education. But for some people, class is something  you are born with. For example, the children of billionaire Donald Trump were born  rich and upper class without having done anything to earn that status.
 Gender plays a role too in how someone can move up the economic ladder.
 Women earn less than men do, so it is harder for them to accumulate wealth. Race  also plays a role in how much people earn and their ability to move up the economic  ladder. In the United States, most families require both the man and woman to work  in order to support the household.
59. ROSA PARKS AND THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT  Rosa Parks is a prime example of how an ordinary American can change the world  around her. She was born in 1913, in the southern state of Alabama. Parks became  famous for challenging a discriminatory policy in the city of Montgomery, Alabama.
 During the 1950s, Black Americans in the south were not allowed to ride in the front  seats of public buses if a white person needed that seat. Blacks were expected to get  out of their seats, and go to the back of the bus, which was designated as "Colored  Only."  On December 1, 1955, Parks refused to obey the bus drivers order to surrender  her seat to a white passenger who had boarded the bus. Even though Parks was  seated in the Colored Only section, the bus was filled, and she was required by law to  give her seat to the white rider. Parks was arrested, and charged with civil  disobedience. She later said she had grown "tired of giving in."  Her arrest and subsequent trial made Parks a national symbol for the Civil Rights  Movement. Her arrest also lead to the Montgomery Bus Boycott that was a political  and social protest campaign against racial segregation. Although the boycott only  lasted 21 days, it was instrumental in the Supreme Court decision to declare  Alabama's practice of segregation unconstitutional.
 Parks has remained a symbol for the Civil Rights Movement even after her death  in 2005 at the age of 92. She has been called the "First Lady of Civil Rights," by the  United States Congress, and "The Mother of the Freedom Movement." She has been  honored by the U.S. government with prestigious awards such as the Presidential  Medal of Freedom, and Congressional Gold Medal. She has been honored with her  own museum in Michigan, and has received several other civil rights awards both  before and after her death.
60. CHICAGO - THE WINDY CITY  Chicago is known as the "Windy City". Some people think this is because of the  breeze that blows almost constantly. The city is located in the state of Illinois on the  shore of one of the Great Lakes, Lake Michigan, which is the fifth largest freshwater  body in the world. Chicago may also be called the windy city because of the wind  tunnel effect created in downtown by many tall buildings.
 Skyscrapers are an important part of Chicago's history. The first skyscraper in the  U.S. was built in the city in 1884. At only 10 stories, it was impressive for its time.
 The skycraper was eventually demolished. Chicago is the home of other famous  firsts. It was the birthplace of the refrigerated rail car, mail-order catalogs, the car  radio, the TV remote control, the first Ferris wheel, the first steel rail road, the first  planetarium in the Western Hemisphere. Chicago is also the home to the first blood  bank and the first drive-in bank. It is also the home to The Lincoln Park Zoo, the  oldest public zoo in the U.S. Maybe the windy city should be called the city of firsts.
 Chicago is the third most populous city in the U.S., after New York City and Los  Angeles. A little more than two and a half million people live in the city that has more  than 100 neighborhoods. President Barack Obama used to live in Chicago.
 Nearly 40 million people visit Chicago every year. Many of them visit the Willis  Tower. Formally known as the Sears Tower, it is the tallest building in the Western  Hemisphere. It takes only a minute to get up to the 103rd floor Skydeck thanks to  some of the fastest elevators in the world. From the Skydeck visitors can see four  states: Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin.
61. BOSTON - A REVOLUTIONARY CITY  Boston is the capital of Massachusetts. It is the largest city in the New England  state and is rich with history. This is why over 12 million people visit the city every  year. It is a very old city, founded in 1630 by English colonists fleeing religious  persecution. The American Revolution, when colonists, known as patriots, fought for  their independence from the British, began in Boston with the Battle of Lexington.
 Other key events in the revolution occurred in the city. One was the Boston Massacre,  when British troops fired upon protesters, killing five. The Boston Tea Party, when  colonists dumped an entire shipment of British tea into the harbor to protest taxes,  was not a party at all. Paul Revere's "midnight ride", where he warned colonists of  British troops approaching, also happened in Boston. Many of these sites can be  accessed by taking a walk down the "Freedom Trail", a red line of bricks embedded in  the ground through the city.
 Boston is also a city of notable firsts. America's first public school was founded in  Boston in 1635. Boston Common, where British troops camped during the American  Revolution and where early colonists hanged people, is the oldest public park in the  United States. Boston is also home to the oldest subway system in the United States.
 Like many cities in the United States, immigrants played a large role in its  development. Irish immigrants who settled in Boston, for example, played a large  role in both local and national politics. Boston also has a large and active Puerto  Rican community and Italian community. President John F. Kennedy and his family  have ties to Boston.
 Boston is also well known for many colleges and universities that surround it.
 Some of the most famous are Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
62. A NATION WAS BORN  The American Revolution was a war of independence fought by those living in the  13 colonies of North America against Great Britain. Those living in the colonies were  especially angry about taxes the British were forcing them to pay. People felt taxes  were unfair because there was no colonial representation in the British parliament.
 One tax was the stamp tax, which taxed printed materials such as newspapers. The  colonists called this "taxation without representation". Colonists who wanted freedom  from English rule were known as Patriots. Those who supported British rule were  known as Loyalists. Before full scale war broke out, there were many acts of protest  by patriots, like the Boston Tea Party when Bostonians boarded British ships and  dumped 342 chests of tea into the harbor because of a tea tax. On April 19 the first  shots were fired in Lexington and Concord, Massachusetts, which officially started the  war.
 Many people were involved in the struggle for independence. Benjamin Franklin,  Thomas Jefferson, and John Adams worked together to write the Declaration of  Independence. On July 4, 1776, patriots declared themselves free. Most people know  George Washington was the first president of the United States. Before that he was  the commander-in-chief of the patriot army. Most of the battles in the American  Revolution were fought in the northeast in places near Boston, and New York.
 The British, known as redcoats because of their red uniform jackets, had help  from German mercenary soldiers called Hessians. Patriots had support from other  Europeans. France entered the American Revolution on the side of the colonists in  1778. This helped force the British surrender at Yorktown, Virginia, in 1779. However,  fighting would not formally end until 1783 with the Treaty of Paris when Great Britain  recognized the United States as an independent nation.
63. THE AMERICAN CIVIL WAR  The American Civil War happened from 1861 to 1865. The main cause was  Southern states feeling that the U.S. federal government in Washington D.C. should  not have the power to tell them what to do. This was especially true about two  issues, taxes and slavery. The Southern economy was based on agriculture while the  Northern economy was based on manufacturing. Southern crops like cotton were sold  to factories and then Southerners had to pay taxes on the finished goods sold back to  them like clothing. Many Southerners felt this was unfair. Additionally the agricultural  economy in the south was reliant on the labor of enslaved Africans and their  descendants. Many people, especially from the North, felt this was wrong and that  slavery needed to be abolished. Southerners felt the abolitionists were threatening  their way of life. Seven Southern slave states, banded together, declared their  secession and formed the Confederate States of America. The government in  Washington D.C. and its army was known as the Union, since they were fighting to  keep the country united.
 Abraham Lincoln was president of the United States during the Civil War. The  President of the Confederate States was Jefferson Davis. The first battle was the  Battle of Fort Sumter. During the war President Lincoln issued the Emancipation  Proclamation, which declared the freedom of slaves in the Confederate States of  America. This action was supposed to show that Lincoln was still in charge of the  entire United States.
 The Civil War was the bloodiest war fought inside the United States. 620,000 were  killed and millions more were injured. One of the bloodiest battles of the Civil War  was the Battle of Gettysburg in Pennsylvania. 51,000 people from both sides died,  more than in any other battle. The Civil War ended in 1865 when General Robert E.
 Lee of the Confederate Army surrendered.
64. FIRES THAT CHANGED CITIES  Fires are destructive. They also create changes. In 1871 a fire burned most of  Chicago to the ground. Many people think the fire was started when a cow knocked  over a gas lamp. Most of the city at the time was built of wood. This, combined with  the famous Chicago winds and a drought, made the city burn down quickly. The fire  lasted for three days. 100,000 people were left homeless, and at least 300 were  killed. What was amazing was how quickly the city was rebuilt, eventually becoming  the third most populous city in the United States.
 The Great Boston Fire of 1872 created a property damage of $73.5 million, more  than any other fire in the U.S. history. Most of Downtown Boston and the financial  district burned down in the fire that began in a warehouse basement. 30 people died,  and thousands lost their jobs and their homes. However, the city was rebuilt in two  years. It began enforcing building regulations because of the fire.
 The 1911 Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire in New York City caused the fourth  highest loss of life from an industrial accident in the U.S. history. 123 women and 23  men, all garment workers and mostly poor immigrants, died from the fire, smoke  inhalation, or falling or jumping to their deaths. Child labor was not uncommon. The  youngest victims were two 14-year-old girls who worked in the factory. So many  people died because the owners of the factory locked the doors to the stairs and  exits. This was to prevent the workers from taking breaks and stealing. As a result of  the fire and huge loss of life, many people began protesting poor working conditions.
 The U.S. Congress passed laws improving factory safety conditions. Women workers  also formed a union to fight for better working conditions.
65. A BEWITCHED CITY  Salem in the state of Massachusetts is called the "Witch City", but don't be afraid.
 There aren't women wearing pointy black hats riding around on brooms. The New  England city is called the Witch City because of an infamous set of trials that  happened there in 1692 to 1693. At the time, the city was just a town in the British  colony of Massachusetts. The Salem Witch Trials accused more than 200 people of  being witches. People believed witchcraft was real and was criminal. Among the  accused were women, men, and even children. Nineteen people were sentenced to  death. They were all hanged. One of the accused was tortured with heavy rocks being  placed on him until he was crushed underneath the weight. Seven others died in jail.
 There was never any proof that those accused, and convicted were really witches.
 Historians think that people would accuse people because of family feuds. Other  historians think that a domino effect occurred, with people becoming hysterical after  one accusation. Fear of witches spread like a disease.
 The Salem Witch Trials have become a part of the city's history. "The Crucible", a  play about the trials by Arthur Miller, has been turned into a movie. The city is not  ashamed of its past, but rather uses it to teach tolerance and earn some tourist  dollars. There is a memorial dedicated to the innocent people who died because of  the witch-hunts. There is a "Witch Museum" that tells the story of what happened.
 Many people visit Salem around Halloween. Salem police cars have witch logos. A  local public school is known as the Witchcraft Heights Elementary School, and the  Salem High School sports teams are named the Witches. Films and television shows  featuring fictional witches have been filmed in Salem, including "Hocus Pocus" and  "Bewitched".
66. THE UNITED NATIONS IN NEW YORK CITY  The United Nations, an international organization founded in 1945 after the  Second World War by 51 countries, has its headquarters along the East River in New  York City. Technically anyone who visits UN Headquarters is not in New York anymore.
 They are not even in the United States. That is because the land and buildings are  considered international territory. The United Nations has its own flag, its own post  office and its own postage stamps. There is no need to change currency, however.
 The UN uses the U.S. Dollar. Six official languages are used at the United Nations.
 They are Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, and Spanish. UN rules override  the laws of New York City. This does not mean that people can commit crimes there  and get away with it. There is no immunity to those who commit crimes there.
 The property where the United Nations now stands used to belong to a  slaughterhouse. The current buildings were completed in 1952. The perimeter of the  UN is lined with flagpoles with the flags of all 193 UN member states and the UN flag.
 They are arranged in alphabetical order in English.
 Some may think it's great to be a neighbor to a peacekeeping agency like the UN.
 Many New Yorkers don't always think so though. Every time a dignitary like a  president or prime minister visits, streets are closed, making it hard to get around  and to find parking.
 You don't need to be a diplomat to visit the UN though. There are tours Monday  through Friday and not just in English. Guided tours are available in English, French,  German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and  Swedish. Visitors can have a meal at the Delegate's Dining Room featuring a buffet of  food from all over the world.
67. NEW YORK CITY - THE BIG APPLE  Apples don't grow in New York City, so that's not why it is called the Big Apple.
 There are many legends about how the city that never sleeps got its name. One story  says that a famous brothel owner named Eve gave the city its name. Another version  of history claims the name has its roots in show business with performers calling New  York the "Big Apple" since it was the best place to get noticed. There is one legend  that says the city got its name because of the large number of unemployed selling  apples on the streets of New York City during the Great Depression.
 The term more likely has its roots in horse racing from the 1920's. Prizes were  called "apples" and a newspaper reporter when writing about races often would call  the big prize the big apple. In fact, the "big apple" soon was used to mean any big  city. In the late 1920s through the 1940s, "The Big Apple" was not just a nickname  for New York, it was also the name of a song, a dance, and a place to dance and sing.
 New York City was the heart of the jazz music scene in the 1930's and 1940s. In  Harlem, uptown Manhattan, there was a club called "The Big Apple". There was also a  1938 short film of the same name featuring black jazz musicians and dancers.
 In the 1970s, the city tourism agency began using the term the "Big Apple" on  purpose. There is even a street corner in Manhattan called "Big Apple Corner". One  New York City baseball team, the New York Mets, have a big red apple that pops out  whenever the Mets hit a home run in their stadium Citifield. While the origins of the  "Big Apple" nickname are unclear, it seems to be here to stay.
68. THE WORLD TRADE CENTER  The original World Trade Center opened in New York City in 1973. The most  famous part of the complex of buildings was the Twin Towers. They were named  because there were almost exactly the same. The only difference is that one had a  tall antenna on the top.
 When they were built, the 1,368-foot tall buildings were the tallest in the world.
 Such tall buildings needed a way for people to travel in them. The towers had 95  elevators in total. Visitors used to travel to the 107th and 110th floors, where there  were observation decks from which one could see the entire city and New Jersey.
 Inside there were offices, shops, a hotel, and on the top floor of one of the towers  there was a restaurant called "Windows on the World". The restaurant even hosted a  salsa night on Thursdays. A number of subway lines ran underneath the towers. The  World Trade Center Complex, with a total of seven buildings, was so large that it had  its own zip code. In 1974 a French man walked a tightrope between the twin towers.
 The World Trade Center survived a bombing in 1993. The skyline and spirit of New  York City were changed after September 11, 2001. That morning, two planes crashed  into the World Trade Center in downtown Manhattan. At first the top floors of the  buildings were in flames. Soon they came tumbling down, covering lower Manhattan  in hot metal and ash. A total of 2,753 people died. For weeks the air smelled of burnt  metal and plastic. It took eight months for the site to be cleaned. Years later, The  World Trade Center is rebuilding. There is a new tower, called the Freedom Tower.
 There is also a memorial and museum to honor those who died in the 2001 attack.
69. CENTRAL PARK  Green isn't the first word that pops into most people's head when they think of  New York City. Yet, in the middle of Manhattan Island is the most visited park in the  United States, with 35 million visitors a year. Central Park, a National Historical  Landmark, takes up 843 acres of land. It is a green space where people go to escape  the noise and crowds of urban life. Before it opened in 1857, it wasn't an empty  space. People lived on that land. They were mostly poor free blacks, Irish, and Italian  immigrants. They were forced off the land to construct the park.
 One section of the park is called Sheep Meadow. Now it's just a grassy area where  people can lie in the sun, but actual sheep used to graze there from 1864 to 1934.
 The sheep from there were eventually moved to another park in the city. Many events  take place in Central Park, especially in the warm spring and summer months. There  is an outdoor theater, where Shakespeare's plays are performed. The plays are free,  which causes such high demand that people line up for hours before performances to  get inside. There are also free music concerts. Every summer a stage is set up. These  Summer Stage concerts feature musicians from all over the world. Both the New York  Philharmonic Orchestra and the Metropolitan Opera also host free performances in  the park in the spring and summer. There are also two small zoos inside the park,  and a number of small lakes in the park. One of the lakes rents out small mechanical  sailboats. There is also a puppet theater and a carousel for kids.
 The park is not dead in the winter. When it snows, families often go to sled or to  go ice-skating in an outdoor rink owned by Donald Trump.
70. THE MARLBORO MAN  The Marlboro Man was a fictional character who appeared in several advertising  campaigns for the Philip Morris Corporation. His ads ran on television from 1964  through 1999, effectively entering the collective conscience of the American people  for generations. Philip Morris is one of the largest tobacco producing companies in the  world, and the corporation used the Marlboro Man with great success over the years.
 The Marlboro Man was a strong, rugged-looking man who rode a mighty horse,  and traveled throughout the country promoting tobacco products. He appeared in  television, radio, print, and billboard ads for decades. When the United States  Surgeon General deemed tobacco smoke as unhealthy in the 1960s, the beginning of  the end for the Marlboro Man had begun. The Surgeon General began an anti smoking campaign by requiring all cigarette companies to place its warning label on  each package sold in the country. The warning included the wording that "Tobacco  smoke can cause lung cancer." Soon the pressure was on the tobacco companies to  curb their advertising campaigns.
 In 1955, tobacco sales reached $15 billion in the United States alone. After the  Marlboro Man was introduced to the American public, that total reached $20 billion.
 This increase was largely based on the Marlboro Man campaign. The company also  started an advertising scheme by offering genuine Marlboro Man gear for sale. These  commodities were of high quality that appealed to the outdoor type of person. The  gear ranged from camping equipment, hats, to outdoor clothing. It was very  successful in its time. This success came at a great expense though. Four men who  portrayed the Marlboro Man died of lung cancer, earning Marlboro cigarettes as the  cowboy killer. The Marlboro Man is still popular in some parts of Europe and Japan,  where smoking is still in vogue.
71. THE BEATLES  The Beatles are an English group of musicians from Liverpool, England. It took  America by storm with their appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show on primetime  television. The group's first appearance was seen by more than 73 million viewers in  February, 1964, introducing the band to the American people. In the months to  follow, the group became the biggest Rock 'N' Roll band ever to hit the United States.
 The group's success opened the door for other British bands to make their way to  America. Bands such as the Rolling Stones, The Who, The Kinks and The Dave Clark  Five were soon playing their music to American audiences.
 The Beatles were made up by four of the finest musicians to ever play rock music.
 Their lead singer was Paul McCartney, and drummer Ringo Starr. Both still play to this  day. Two of the original members, singers and songwriters, John Lennon, and George  Harrison, have tragically passed away, but their music lives in American culture to  this day. The Beatles have sold more records in the United States than any other  country in the world.
 There was controversy in the U.S. prior to the group's first appearance.
 Conservative Americans viewed the Beatles as upstarts, with brash, new ideas, lyrics,  and sound. The young generation of the time was ready for a change, and the  Beatles gave them what they wanted. They were nicknamed the "Mop Tops" because  of their long, bowl-like haircuts that flew in the face of convention in the 60s. Nothing  was going to stop the Beatles though. Their music is as popular today as it was 50  plus years ago. This February, the Grammy Awards presented a special telecast  celebrating the 50th anniversary of the group's first appearance on the Ed Sullivan  Show.
72. THE GRIFFITH OBSERVATORY  The Griffith Observatory is a planetarium, and an exhibit hall located in Los  Angeles's Griffith Park. It features several astronomical displays and telescopes in the  Hollywood Hills in the Los Feliz district of the city. The Observatory was built on land  donated by Griffith J. Griffith in 1896. Griffith was a Welsh-born philanthropist and  mining tycoon, who wanted to give the public access to a state-of-the-art  observatory, so it was free of charge to visitors. He felt common people should be  able to enjoy the wonders of the universe, and not be solely for the scientific  community.
 Griffith donated 3,015 acres of land specifically to house the observatory that  opened on May 14, 1935. During the first five days after the opening, the  planetarium averaged more than 13,000 visitors a day. One of the major attractions  was the Foucault Pendulum that is designed to show the earth's rotation and the  Zeiss reflecting telescope. The observatory has a striking view of Los Angeles and  Hollywood, and the Pacific Ocean can be seen on clear days from there.
 In 2002 the planetarium was subjected to a $93 million renovation and  expansion, which closed the museum for four years. After it reopened in 2006, the  facility expanded underground with new exhibits, a cafe, a gift shop, and a theater.
 The Wilder Hall of the Eye section concentrates on the astronomical aspect of the  observatory. It is where people can view the stars through the observatory's  telescope, and features an interactive exhibit that is very popular. The Ahmanson Hall  of the Sky is another popular attraction for viewing images in the night sky that are  visible to the naked eye. The observatory frequently stages viewing nights when the  public is invited to bring their own telescopes. It is open daily, and remains free of  charge.
73. ONE COUNTRY, MANY RELIGIONS  The United States is a country that has people from all over the world. Not only  do many people speak different languages, many people practice different religions.
 Most people in the U.S. identify as being Christian, but only half of those people  attend church on a regular basis. The second most popular religion is Judaism. The  third most common religion in the U.S. is Islam. Other religions practiced in the U.S  include Hinduism, and Buddhism. About 20 percent of all people in the U.S. say they  don't practice any religion. One of the founding principles of the United States is  religious freedom, which means people can practice whatever religion they want  without being discriminated against. This is even guaranteed in the U.S. Constitution.
 This is one reason why the United States has no official religion.
 Because there are so many different religions in the United States, there are  many different types of houses of worship. Christians attend churches. Jews and  Hindus attend temples. Muslims attend mosques. Many people use what they wear to  reflect their religious beliefs. For example, some Islamic women wear a scarf called  "hijab" to cover their head. It is disrespectful to ask a Muslim woman to take off her  hijab or ask for her to show you what is under it. Male followers of an Indian religion  called "Sikhism" usually wear cotton turbans. Again it is wrong to take a person's  turban off or ask that they take it off. Male followers of Hasidism, a branch of  Judaism, have long curls on the side of their heads. They wear a fringed prayer  shawl. Other Jewish men may wear a small cap on their heads called a yarmulke.
 This is supposed to be a constant reminder that God is above them.
74. WOODSTOCK: DEFINING A GENERATION  The Woodstock Music and Art Fair, commonly called Woodstock, was an American  music and art celebration that took place from August 15 - 18, 1969. It was billed as  "3 Days of Peace and Music," and was a defining event for the young generation of  Americans of the time.
 The 1960s was an impactful era in American history. Many of the events that took  place during those controversial 10 years profoundly affect modern American society  today. The war in Vietnam was raging in the 60s, and the popular president, John F.
 Kennedy was assassinated in 1963. These are just two of the events that defined the  decade. There were many more historic events during that era that deeply divided  the country. Woodstock was designed to show how the young generation can coexist  with the older generation of Americans by living in harmony with one another.
 Although the event did not occur in the town of Woodstock, New York, the city has  become synonymous with the celebration. More than 400,000 young people gathered  at the dairy farm in the small town of White Lake, New York to witness music history  in the making. Rolling Stone Magazine listed the event as one of "the 50 Moments  that Changed the History of Rock 'n' Roll." Some of the biggest names in rock history  performed at the three-day event, including The Who, the Grateful Dead, Janis Joplin,  Jefferson Airplane, and Jimi Hendrix. In all, 32 acts performed at the outdoor festival,  and it was free of charge to all.
 Two soundtracks were released in the following two years. Both albums featured  the live performances with introductions. The documentary film "Woodstock" was  released in 1970, and received an Oscar in the Academy Award for Feature  Documentary category. It was also deemed a Culturally Significant, by the United  States, Library of Congress.
75. THE VETERANS ADMINISTRATION  The United States Department of Veterans Affairs, more commonly known as the  Veterans Administration, is an organization dedicated to provide services for all  veterans of the U.S. military. It was formed in July 1930, and today employs  approximately 280,000 people at hundreds of its offices throughout the U.S. Its  annual budget for the 2014 fiscal year is nearly $153 billion, making it one of the  largest government agencies in existence today.
 The Department is broken into three main subdivisions. It consists of the Veterans  Health Administration, the Veterans Benefits Administration, and the National  Cemetery Administration. The VA Health Administration is responsible for providing  veterans with all health care issues, while the Benefits Administration is designed to  help veterans in areas such as guaranteed home loans, insurance vocational  rehabilitation and educational benefits. The National Cemetery Administration  provides burial and memorial benefits, and is entrusted with the maintenance of the  VA's cemeteries.
 Since that time, the VA has expanded greatly, and now provides additional  services such as educational benefits, and home-buying assistance. It also helps  those veterans who had become homeless after their service to their country ended.
 There are approximately 30 million military veterans living in the U.S. today. That  number represents nearly 10 percent of the population of the country today.
76. MARRIED WITH CHILDREN  One of the most impactful television series ever to run on American TV was  Married with Children. The show aired on the FOX Channel for 11 years, and many  believe it was responsible for keeping the news station alive during the early years.
 In 1987, commercial TV in the United States was dominated by the big three: the  American Broadcasting Company (ABC), the National Broadcasting Company (NBC),  and the Columbia Broadcasting Company (CBS). When the FOX Channel appeared on  the scene, few people gave it much chance to survive in the face of its stiff  competition, but Married with Children changed all that.
 The show followed the exploits of a dysfunctional family that lived in a fictional  suburb of Chicago. The main character was the father, Al Bundy, who was a lovable  loser living with his self-centered wife, and bratty kids. Together, the family makes  Al's life miserable as he stumbles, and fumbles his way through life. Al works as a  shoe salesman that pays very little, and has little chance of promotion.
 Al is an endearing character who gained the adoration of the American public for  many years. The actor Ed O'Neil, who played Al, said that people still approach him to  this day calling him Al, or Mr. Bundy. O'Neil also said that playing the character for so  many years made it difficult for him to find work once the series ended because  people associated him with Al.
 One of the things that made the show so popular is that no subject was off-limits  to the writers. It was a controversial show that dealt with controversial subjects.
 Many people boycotted the show because of its racy content, but FOX continued on.
 The show has cultivated a cult-like following that began in the 80s, and continues  today.
77. FACEBOOK  One of the most recent social changes taking place in the United States, and in  the world, is social networking. Social networking in itself is not a new development.
 These types of groups have been in existence for at least 150 years, and probably  longer than that. In the times before the invention of the personal computer, and the  advent of the World Wide Web, social networking was done in person. People who  had similar likes and interests would gather together to share experiences, make new  contacts, and promote themselves, or their businesses.
 On the Internet, social networking websites made their first appearances during  the late 1990s. The first major social networking website in the United States was  MySpace. MySpace was a comprehensive, social networking site that allowed its  users to exchange messages, share pictures, and make new friends in a way that was  never thought of in the past. With MySpace, people who did not go out much could  reach out to others from the comfort of their own homes.
 In 2004, Facebook was created. It was originally a website created for use by  Harvard University students, graduates, and faculty, but it soon expanded to include  just about everyone. Facebook is an elaborate social networking site that has grown  incredibly fast. It is now larger than some of the largest companies in the world. It is  a website that is in constant change. New features are added regularly. Facebook has  revolutionized the way people stay connected with each other and the rest of the  world. The way it works is simple. Users can set up a new account easily. All a new  user needs is an email address to start. Once a person has created an account, he, or  she can invite friends by sending a request out to people they know who also have  their own Facebook pages. Once you get started, making new friends will come  easily.
78. DON'T BE TARDY TO THE PARTY  In the United States, people love to throw parties for many reasons. Of course  there are the usual birthday parties, but some people even have parties to celebrate  divorces! No matter what kind of party you are going to, it's a good idea to make  sure you are actually invited. It's considered rude to just show up unless the host,  the person giving the party, invited you. You will either get a paper, email or verbal  invitation to a party. Alternately, you can also go as a guest of someone else invited,  like as his or her date. Once invited, it is very important to let the host know if you  are actually going to show up. Many times hosts have a party catered, which means  other people prepare the food. They need to know how much food to have. Letting  them know if you are showing up or not helps the host and is considered polite.
 It's also important to be relatively punctual for a party. Most parties in the U.S.
 never start exactly when they say they will. Many people like to be "fashionably late",  that is, showing up about 30 minutes after the party is supposed to start. People like  to do this to make a big entrance. Showing up more than 30 minutes before or after  is considered rude though. If you show up too early, you are likely to interrupt  valuable preparation time of the host. If you show up too late, you are just being  rude.
 Even if it is not a birthday party, it is polite to bring a gift for the host. It doesn't  need to be a fancy gift. A bottle of wine, or even flowers, is polite and will be  appreciated.
79. A BRIDAL SHOWER  A bridal shower is a party when a woman who is about to get married is  "showered" with gifts and well wishes. A bride-to-be will often register at one or  several department stores and create a list of things she would like people to give her  as presents. This makes it easy for guests of both the bridal shower and the wedding  itself to know what kind of things the bride wants. A registry also makes sure that  there are no duplicate presents. A bride may want a blender, but she sure doesn't  want to receive three and have to deal with the hassle of returning extras. Most  bridal shower gifts are items that a newly married couple needs to start their life  together. These gifts include dishes, pots, pans, and even appliances like toasters and  microwave ovens. Many brides also look forward to receiving some money. Cash or  checks are considered appropriate gifts for a bridal shower. The money comes in  handy to help pay for an expensive wedding. Sometimes people bring tasteless gifts  like lingerie to bridal showers. Some people think those gifts are good because they  help the new couple "spice up" their married life. Others find these types of presents  embarrassing.
 While many bridal showers are surprises, others are planned with input from the  bride-to-be. A bridal shower can be small and intimate and held in someone's home.
 It can also be a larger affair held at a restaurant or a catering hall. Sometimes snacks  and desserts are served or a full meal can be offered. Traditionally bridal showers  were women only affairs. However, more and more showers are no co-ed, with men  and women. Traditionally men are not invited to bridal showers but now more  showers include men and the groom-to-be. Like many parties in the U.S., there  would be no dancing at the bridal shower, just eating and people chatting. Some  bridal showers even have games.
80. A BABY SHOWER  While many women are involved in planning their bridal showers, a baby shower  usually comes as a complete surprise. A baby shower is a party where a pregnant  woman is "showered" with gifts and good wishes. A baby shower is usually given by a  close female friend or relative of the mother-to-be. Sometimes co-workers of a  pregnant person will also throw a baby shower.
 The baby shower is usually given when the mother-to-be is between 6 and 9  months pregnant. Sometimes though, because predicting the due date of a baby isn't  always exact, a baby shower can happen after the baby is born. A baby shower can  be held in someone's home or outside, like in a restaurant or catering hall.
 Traditionally only women are invited to a baby shower. However, more and more baby  showers are also including the father-to-be. Like with a bridal shower, a mother-to-be  will often register a wish list of things she wants at one or several stores. This list  usually consists of things the mother wants for her baby including clothes, diapers  and even furniture like high chairs and cribs. This way friends and family members  can go to the store and buy something from the list. Registering helps make sure that  there aren't repeat items, like 30 bottles when a new mom only needed 15.
 Some baby showers also feature a paper mache wishing well. This is not just for  decoration. People can put cards inside with wishes for the new baby and mom. Most  of these cards also contain money or gift cards to help the mom-to-be buy whatever  else she needs for the baby. Sometimes there are games at a baby shower. In one  game everyone guesses the due date of the baby. Another game has people taste  baby food and guess the flavor 81. A HOUSEWARMING PARTY  A housewarming party is a special party to be held when someone buys or moves  into a new apartment or house. The person or people who bought the property or  moved are the ones who throw the party. The party is an opportunity for friends and  family to congratulate the person on the new home. It also gives people a chance to  see what the new home looks like. It is an opportunity to fill the new space with love  and hopefully presents.
 It is traditional to bring a gift to a housewarming party. Some people register a  list of items they want or need for their new home at a local store or stores. Some  common items people will put on a gift registry include kitchen tools like knives and  items like curtains. Even if there isn't a registry, a good housewarming gift is  something to decorate the new house with like a piece of art or a plant. You can also  bring food or drinks to share with the other guests. This is often appreciated since at  a housewarming there isn't a lot of food served, usually just appetizers or  sandwiches. There are usually no planned activities like games at a house warming  party. The host or hostess of the party will, however, probably give all the guests a  tour of their new home. Sometimes, because a housewarming party happens shortly  after a person moves into their new home, people may be asked to help unpack  boxes. This isn't usual though.
 Housewarming parties get their name from the fact that a long time ago people  would actually bring firewood to a new home as a gift. This was so that the person  could keep their home warm for the winter. Now most homes have central heating  and don't use fires to keep warm.
82. THE WEDDING RECEPTION (1)  The religious or civil ceremony that makes people legally a married couple is just  one part of the actual wedding. After the wedding comes the reception. A wedding  reception is a party held immediately after the marriage ceremony. Usually there is a  little bit of time, about an hour, between the ceremony and the reception to give  people enough time to travel from the ceremony location to the reception location.
 Most wedding receptions are held at a catering hall, which is a place that specializes  in hosting big parties. However, wedding receptions can be held in restaurants, parks,  and even in museums or zoos. A wedding reception is usually not held at the same  place as the ceremony, but sometimes they do.
 When guests arrive at the reception, the bride and groom are usually not there to  meet them. Right after the ceremony the newly married couple, the bridesmaids, and  the groomsmen will go somewhere to have photographs taken. While this is  happening, guests are usually treated to a cocktail hour at the reception site. During  this time appetizers and drinks are served. This also gives guests a chance to  socialize. After the cocktail hour, the main dining hall is opened. At a wedding  reception the seating is usually prearranged. Each guest will receive a card telling  him or her where they are expected to sit. Tables are arranged by numbers. In front  of the reception hall, there is a special table for the bride and groom.
 Once everyone is seated, waiters begin to serve salad or bread and drinks. Some  receptions have an open bar, meaning the alcohol is free. Other receptions have a  case bar, meaning non-alcoholic beverages are free; guests are expected to pay for  their own alcoholic drinks.
83. THE WEDDING RECEPTION (2)  There can be different kinds of entertainment at a wedding reception. Usually  there will be a Master of Ceremonies, or MC, who helps move the reception along by  making announcements of what will happen next. For example, the MC will announce  when the newly married couple enters the reception hall, and all the guests will stand  up and applaud. A wedding reception usually has music and guests are expected to  dance. The music can be provided by a DJ or by a live band. Sometimes the DJ or  live band will accept requests from guests to play a certain song. When the newly  married couple enters the reception, they will share a dance by themselves to a song  they picked beforehand. Usually the song is something romantic and represents the  couple's love for one another. Sometimes the bride will share a dance with her father  and the groom will share a dance with his mother. After these special dances, the  guests are invited to the dance floor.
 Food at a wedding reception can be buffet style, where everyone serves himself or  herself, or it can be a sit-down meal served by waiters. Guests get to choose among  a meat, chicken or fish deal. Guests generally make their choices when they respond  to the initial wedding invitations.
 During a wedding, guests shouldn't expect to spend too much time with the bride  and groom. The new couple is usually very busy greeting all of their guests.
 Sometimes the couple doesn't even get a chance to eat. What almost every newly  married couple does get to eat at their wedding reception is the wedding cake. The  bride and groom traditionally cut through the wedding cake together, and then feed  the other person a bite.
84. BRIDE AND GROOM TRADITIONS  There are many traditions that U.S. brides and grooms are expected to follow at  their wedding. One of the most well-known traditions is for a bride to toss her bridal  bouquet to the unmarried female guests attending her reception. According to the  tradition, the single woman who catches the bouquet will be the next woman to be  married. The flowers thrown may not be actually the same flowers the bride carries  down the aisle during the wedding ceremony. An identical bouquet is created for the  bride to toss. This is because many times the bride wants to keep her original  bouquet as a remembrance. Many women take the flower toss very seriously. There  have been videos documenting how women will sometimes even fight each other for  the bridal bouquet.
 The groom has something to toss at the wedding reception, too. One tradition is  the groom takes a garter from his new wife's leg and toss the garter to the unmarried  men attending the reception. According to the tradition, the single man who catches  the garter will be the next man to get married. Sometimes the groom will remove the  garter from his wife's leg with his teeth. At some wedding receptions, the man who  catches the garter has to place it on the leg of the woman who catches the bridal  bouquet. Some people think this is too sexual, and just skip this part. It is the  decision of the bride and groom.
 The bride and groom often toast each other with champagne before the end of the  reception. Sometimes a bride and groom will leave the reception before it is over.
 They go right to the airport to begin their honeymoon, a special vacation celebrating  their new life together.
85. THEME PARTIES  Who says adult parties have to be boring. More and more adults are reliving their  childhoods or creating memories they didn't have as children by having theme parties  for their birthday or other occasions.
 Theme parties are based on an idea, a television show, a fictional character, or  really anything. Sometimes guests are expected to dress according to the theme as  well. For example, the Toga party is a type of theme party where guests are expected  to dress in togas, really just white sheets. Toga parties used to be especially popular  among college students. In a masquerade party, everyone wears a mask and has to  guess who is behind it. The mystery is part of the fun. Speaking of mystery, there are  murder mystery parties, where the guests have to solve a fake murder. Some adults  throw parties based on seasons. A summer beach party, for example, might feature  guests wearing their swimsuits. Another popular type of theme party is the game  night party. In this type of party, people get together to play various board games. A  variation of the game night party is the casino party, where adults play games  typically found in a casino-like blackjack or poker.
 Another theme party could focus on a specific region or country. For example, a  Mexican theme party might feature tacos, the colors of the Mexican flag and Mexican  music. Guests should be careful when dressing up for these types of theme parties  though. Dressing up like a certain ethnic or racial group is usually considered  offensive. It's better to just enjoy the food, and not portray a stereotype.
86. HELICOPTER VERSUS FREE-RANGE MOMS  The parenting styles of parents in the United States are often criticized. One type  of parenting that is criticized is a helicopter parent. This kind of parents hover over  their children like helicopters, which means these parents are always on top of their  children.
 While being an aware and involved parent is not a bad thing, helicopter parents  take it to the extreme. The actions of helicopter parents actually hurt children, by not  teaching them to be responsible for their actions. For example, a helicopter parents  would call their adult college-age child to wake them up to go to class when part of  college is learning to be responsible and learning to manage your own time.
 Helicopter parents are also overly worried about their kids getting hurt. This means  helicopter parents hold back their child's natural curiosity. Part of growing up means  your kid has to get hurt, physically and emotionally. This is how lessons are learned.
 Instead, the kids of helicopter parents can grow up to be overly needy, dependent  adults. Some people blame the rise of helicopter parenting on the rise of cell phones.
 Mobile phones make it easier for parents to track their kids all the time.
 The opposite of the helicopter mom is the free-range mom. The free-range mom  follows a slow parenting style, meaning she lets her kids explore the world at their  own pace with little direction. The name free-range comes from the idea that kids  should have the freedom to explore their world or range in a way that makes sense  to them. This often means that free-range moms will not schedule activities like extra  classes or play dates for their kids. Instead a free-range mom will just let her child  play in a park. There is less of an emphasis on things like the latest toys.
87. ATTACHMENT PARENTING  Having your kid physically attached to you probably doesn't sound like fun, but an  American pediatrician, William Sears, promotes a style of parenting that keeps small  children as physically attached as possible. This is called attachment parenting.
 The idea behind attachment parenting is that if a small baby feels protected and  safe by physical contact with their parent, especially their mother, that child will grow  up to be a more independent adult. One way parents are encouraged to be close to  their babies is by using a sling or a wrap to carry the baby around instead of putting  the baby in a carriage. This is often called "wearing" your baby. Parents are also  encouraged to sleep with their babies. Parents are too big to fit in a crib, so instead  parents are told to bring the baby into the adult bed. This is supposed to teach the  baby about sleep regulation as well since the baby will learn to mimic adult sleep  patterns. This co-sleeping is controversial though. There are concerns that babies  sleeping with adults could suffocate, accidentally get crushed, or fall off the bed.
 There is also concern about sudden infant death syndrome, or SIDS, where babies  just suddenly stop breathing.
 Another marker of attachment parenting is not worrying about spoiling a baby.
 Many times parents feel that paying attention to a baby's every cry makes them too  needy or spoiled. Attachment parenting feels that every baby's cry should be  responded to and that the baby should never be left to "cry it out." Instead, the baby  should be comforted and crying should be taken as a signal that the baby needs  something. Most attachment parents also breastfeed on demand, feeling that not  only is this physically healthier, but also promotes a bond between mother and child.
88. A KID'S PARTY FOR ADULTS  Not all kids' birthday parties in the U.S. are created equal. Sometimes it seems  like the birthday parties are about showing off and entertaining the parents of kids in  addition to children.
 Most children's birthday parties are held in the home of the birthday boy or girl. It  used to be that children's parties were just for children. Parents would drop their kids  off and come back when the party was over to bring them home. Now it is more  common for the parents of guests to stay for the party as well. This gives the adults  time and space to socialize while the kids play games. Kids and adults don't always  have the same tastes in food. So when adults are invited to stay for a child's birthday  party, there is usually fancier food for the adults like cheese, crackers, and fruit  platters. Meanwhile the kids eat hot dogs and potato chips. While the children drink  punch, juice, or soda, the parents may be sipping cocktails, beer, or wine.
 Entertainment for a party of mixed adults and children also goes beyond the usual  clown or magician. Sometimes there will be a DJ, and the adults will dance. Party  games are not just for the kids, either. While the children play traditional games like  pin the tail on the donkey, the adults may play casino-type games like blackjack or  poker.
 Not everyone likes this trend of adults and children partying together. Some feel  that the parties should be kept separate. Some people worry about adults getting  drunk in front of the kids. Others worry about kids getting abused by adults they  don't know. For others, it is just about allowing a kid to have their special day. There  is also a concern that these mixed parties encourage a sense of competition among  parents in a community.
89. WHEN A KID BECOMES AN ADULT  In the United States someone legally becomes an adult when they turn 18 years  old. At 18, U.S. citizens can vote. They can also serve in the military and go fight in  wars for the country. An 18-year old can also buy cigarettes and other tobacco  products, but 18-year-olds cannot buy alcoholic beverages. People in the U.S. need to  wait until they are 21 to be able to do that.
 At the age of 18, people can legally live on their own, work, and get married.
 However, turning 18 doesn't mean everyone is ready to take on adult responsibilities.
 At the age of 18, most people are just graduating from high school. Many will go to  college. Some young people choose to go to college far from their homes and live in  dormitories. Others pick a college close to home and stay with their parents to save  money. Yet others will choose to live on their own. Legally, a parent does not have to  provide for their child when the child turns 18.
 Some parents in the U.S. take this very seriously and expect their children to  move out as soon as they turn 18. Some parents will even forcibly kick their kids out  when the kids turn 18. There tends to be some difference about this depending on if  the kid is female or male. It is considered more acceptable for a female to stay living  with her parents after her 18th birthday. Many females aren't expected to leave their  parents' house until they get married. There is still an expectation for young men,  however, to go out and live independent lives as soon as they can. With the economy  of the U.S. struggling, some adult children are returning to their parents' home in  their 20s and 30s. These are called boomerang kids, since like a boomerang, they  return where they came from.
90. TAKING CARE OF MOM AND DAD  In the United States, the baby boomer generation includes those that were born  in the time after World War II. Those babies are now reaching the retirement age. As  these adults age, many of their adult children worry about how they will take care of  their aging parents. In the United States it is not common for multiple generations to  live under one roof. Once children grow up and get married, they move out, leaving  their aging parents to fend for themselves. When these aging parents can no longer  take care of themselves because of age or illness, it is not uncommon for adult  children in the U.S. to place their elderly parents in a nursing home.
 A nursing home is a facility that offers care for the elderly and ill 24 hours a day.
 As the name suggests, nursing homes has medical nurses, doctors, social workers,  and therapists to help aging adults deal with the challenges of daily life. Most nursing  homes also have social activities for the elderly to engage in and keep active. These  activities range from games to dance classes, and movie nights. Nursing homes are  supposed to provide three nutritious meals for their residents.
 Nursing homes are controversial, however. There have been cases across the  country of staff in nursing homes abusing and even robbing the elderly residents.
 There are different states and federal agencies that are supposed to oversee nursing  home facilities. Some people feel that it should be the responsibility of family  members, especially adult children, to care for their aging or ill parents. However,  many adult children have their own children and families to take care of, and do not  have the means to care for their elderly parents; others worry about medical skills  needed if their elderly parents are seriously ill.
91. VACATION TIME  The stereotype is that Americans are lazy, but studies show that people in the  U.S. get less vacation time than people in other parts of the world. A typical American  worker gets two or three weeks off out of a whole year for vacation. Most U.S.
 workers cannot take those two or three weeks consecutively. They usually have to be  spread out throughout the year. Even when U.S. workers are on vacation, they are  often expected to be in communication with their boss. This means checking in via  email and mobile phone. Most U.S. businesses do not encourage their employees to  take all the vacation days they are entitled to. In fact, most U.S. companies  discourage it.
 Other countries, especially countries in Europe, have much more vacation time. In  Germany many people have six weeks of paid vacation. At least three of these weeks  can be taken consecutively. Maybe this is why Europeans and other travelers vacation  in far-off exotic places. Most American families tend to stay closer to home, rarely  leaving the country.
 The difference in the amount of vacation time is legal. Most companies in  countries outside the U.S. have to give paid time off to their employees or else pay  hefty fines. However, in the U.S. there is no federal law requiring employers to give  workers paid vacation. In fact the U.S. is the only developed country that doesn't  guarantee yearly time off to workers. There have been efforts to pass laws giving  U.S. workers one week of paid vacation by law, but so far those efforts have not been  successful.
 Even when U.S. workers do have time off, many are afraid to take it because they  worry they may be seen as non-productive workers and lose their job. Other workers  worry about going on vacation and having a mountain of work when they return.
92. CAMPING  Camping is a popular way for many people in the United States to spend their  vacation. Camping involves people leaving the comfort of their home and driving to  spend a few nights or more in the great outdoors.
 When people camp, they can sleep in a tent, a camper, or if they want to be  fancier, they can sleep in a cabin. Some people like to really "rough it" and use no  shelter except for a sleeping bag and sleep under the stars. Some people drive across  the U.S. in what is known as a recreational vehicle or RV, which is a trailer. Inside  there are beds, a tiny bathroom and a kitchen.
 There are campgrounds all over the United States. These are places where  campers gather together and usually pay a fee to pitch a tent or place a camper in a  designated outdoor spot. Many of these campgrounds have water hoses and electric  hookups so that people can wash dishes and themselves and plug in a radio or their  computers. Most campsites also have a fire ring or pit, which is a hole in the ground  where people can safely make a fire for roasting marshmallows, a popular camping  activity. There usually is also a picnic table for people to eat their meals. Many of  these campgrounds also have shared bathrooms complete with showers. Some  campgrounds have playgrounds, pools, and game rooms. Some also organize  activities for people who like sing-alongs, where people will gather together and sing  songs. Usually it is illegal to camp in a place not designated as an official campsite,  meaning you can't just pitch a tent in a forest.
 When people go camping they often do other outdoor activities like fishing,  canoeing, hiking, kayaking, swimming, horseback riding and mountain biking.
93. RENTING AN APARTMENT (1)  Having your own space is a sign of success in the United States. However, renting  an apartment is not easy. There are a number of steps you need to take. First, you  need to figure out how much you can pay per month.
 When you first move into a new place, most landlords, or property owners expect  you, the tenant, to pay a security deposit. A security deposit is an amount of money  you pay a landlord sort of as insurance that you won't destroy their property while  you are living there. Usually the security deposit is equal to the amount of one-month  rent. If when you move out, the apartment is in the same condition as when you  moved in, the landlord will return your security deposit. If the apartment has any  damage whatsoever, including holes in the walls because you hung up posters, the  landlord can legally use that money to fix the apartment.
 Once you know how much you can afford, you can begin looking for apartments  for rent. You can look in the newspaper or online. Also walk around a neighborhood  you want to live in and be on the lookout for "For Rent" signs.
 There are two ways to rent an apartment. Most landlords rent out apartments on  an annual basis. This means you will sign a document called a lease, which says you  will stay in the property for one year and pay rent on a monthly basis. If you decide  that you want to break the lease, or leave before your year is up, there are usually  fines you will have to pay. Another way to rent an apartment is on a month-to-month  basis. This means that you pay by month, and are not obligated to stay for more  than a month at a time.
94. RENTING AN APARTMENT (2)  Once you find an apartment you want to rent, you need to contact the landlord,  the person who owns the property. Most landlords are not individuals anymore, but  rather are companies that own a number of properties. You and the landlord will set a  date to view the place you are interested in renting.
 On that date you can see the apartment and ask questions. Some landlords will  require you to fill out an application. The application will ask questions about your  job, salary, and how many people are going to live with you in the apartment. The  landlord wants to make sure they have responsible tenants who will pay rent on time.
 Some landlords will even ask for references, the names and telephone numbers of  people who can verify that you have a job and are a responsible person. Most  landlords will also run a credit check. A credit check is your history of paying bills on  time. If your potential landlord sees that you owe a lot of money to different  companies and don't pay your bills on time, they may not want you as a tenant. If  you have bad credit or an unstable work history, you may be required to get a co signer, that is another financially responsible adult to sign the lease, a rental contract,  with you. This co-signer is legally responsible for paying the rent if you stop paying.
 If you cannot afford a full apartment, another option is to rent a room in  someone's home. The process to rent a room is like renting an apartment except you  only have a room and usually have to share the bathroom and the kitchen. Most  apartments and rooms in the U.S. are unfurnished. You are expected to bring your  own furniture, including a bed, a dresser, a sofa, and anything else you need.
95. WHAT IS IN A LEASE (1)  If you want to rent an apartment, you need to sign a lease, which is a legally  binding contract between you and the landlord, the person who owns the property. A  lease is usually good for a set time. Some leases are on a month-to-month basis, but  most are for a period of one year or two years.
 The lease or rental agreement lists out your responsibilities as a tenant and the  landlord's responsibilities. The lease will tell you how much the monthly rent is, when  it is due, and how you can pay it. Some landlords will only take a certified check or  money order, and others will accept a personal check or cash. If you pay your rent  late, there is usually a late fee. The amount of the late fee is also usually in the lease.
 The lease will also tell you how much the security deposit is. Usually it is the amount  of one month's rent. The lease will tell you if you can have pets or not. Many places  do not allow pets. If you bring one in anyway, they can fine you or kick you out. If  your apartment does allow pets, most likely you will have to pay an extra amount of  money, called a pet deposit, to cover any damages caused by the animal. Other rules  that may be included in a lease include whether you are allowed to smoke inside the  property and whether you are allowed to make any changes like paint. Many  landlords do not allow you to paint or even make holes in the wall to hang up  pictures.
 A lease is proof that you legally live somewhere. Sometimes you need a lease to  show a school that you live within a certain area. Make sure you get a copy of the  signed lease from your landlord.
96. WHAT IS IN A LEASE (2)  When you rent an apartment, you need to check the lease for rules and  responsibilities. For example, some landlords do not want you to have guests spend  the night. This is because the landlord doesn't know who your guests are. If they  damage the apartment in any way, you will be responsible. Also sometimes a friend  who wants to crash on your couch ends up staying for a really long time, and ends up  becoming another tenant.
 You are responsible for all the utilities you use while living in a rental apartment.
 This means you will have to pay for the electricity and gas you use. If the landlord  pays for any utilities, it will say so in the lease. Once you move in, you will have to  call the electric company and the gas company so they can put accounts in your  name. Also if you want a phone line, cable or Internet, you will have to call those  companies and pay for those services yourself unless the lease says that is included  in your rent.
 Your landlord is supposed to have access to the apartment you are renting from  them. This doesn't mean they can just barge in whenever. It does mean though that  with notice, the landlord is allowed to come into the apartment during a reasonable  time, meaning not in the middle of the night when you are sleeping. During this time  the landlord will inspect the apartment to make sure you are following the rules, and  the landlord can also make any necessary repairs. All of this should be written out on  the lease. If it is not, do not be afraid to ask the landlord to add that information. It  protects both the landlord and you.
97. PUBLIC HOUSING  If you have a low income, are elderly, or are disabled, there are a number of  public housing options in the United States. Public housing options are run by the  federal, state, and city government agencies. Living in public housing is often called  "living in the projects", but this is a negative term based on stereotypes. Not all  public housing options mean living in huge, run-down buildings with lots of crime.
 Public housing programs come in all sizes and types. One type is a single-family  house. Another type includes living in a high-rise building, or apartments in tall  buildings. All public housing options are rental options, meaning you do not own the  place where you live.
 Eligibility for public housing is based on a number of factors. One factor is your  annual gross income, meaning how much money you make in a year. Another factor  is if you are elderly or have a disability. Another factor taken into consideration is  your U.S. citizenship or eligible immigration status. Most public housing options are  only available to U.S. citizens or U.S. legal residents. Like with any rental, your  references are checked to make sure you and your family will be good tenants. This  means looking at your credit history and your criminal record. People with criminal  records are usually banned or not allowed to use public housing options.
 To find out if you are eligible for public housing, you need to visit a government  housing assistance office close to you. You can find your local housing assistance  office by checking the yellow pages or by looking online. You will have to fill out an  application. On the application you will need to list the names, gender, and date of  birth of all people who would be living in the house or apartment.
98. APPLYING FOR PUBLIC HOUSING  When you apply for public housing, on the application you need to give the names  and ages of everyone who will live with you. You will also need to give the address of  where you currently live and a phone number which you can be contacted with.
 In your application, you need to explain why you think you qualify for public  housing help. Some reasons can include being a veteran, being poor, or living in bad  conditions. Bad conditions can mean that the place you are living now is dangerous  or it can mean that you are in a domestic violence situation. The government will also  want to know the name and contact information of your current landlord and any  landlords you had in the past. This is so that the government can find out if you are a  good tenant. You will also need to tell the government how much money you make in  a year and how you make that money. You can't just make that information up. You  will need to provide your boss's information, old checks, and bank statements.
 The government may visit you in your current home and interview you and people  you live with. Other things the government will ask for are your birth certificate and  the birth certificates of all people who will live with you and proof that you pay taxes,  like a tax return. If you are eligible for any public housing assistance, you will get a  letter. If you're approved, you'll be put on a waiting list. You may be on the waiting  list for a long time before you actually can move into a public housing unit. This is  because there are many people applying and eligible for help. Sometimes you can be  waiting for years.
99. SECTION 8  Section 8 is also called the housing choice voucher program. Very poor families,  the elderly, and disabled people can get up to about 2,000 dollars a month to help  pay rent in single-family homes and apartments. Families who qualify do not get a  completely free ride though. In order to qualify, you must be able to pay about 30  percent of the rent yourself. The rest of the rent is paid directly by the government to  a landlord. Not all landlords accept Section 8. If you qualify for Section 8, it is your  responsibility to find a landlord who accepts the program.
 Eligibility for the program depends on your annual income and how many people  are in your family. To qualify you have to be a U.S. citizen or a legal resident of the  U.S. If you are undocumented or have a tourist visa, you cannot apply for this  program. Like with all public housing programs, you will have to fill out an application  to see if you qualify. On the application you will have to say how much money you  make, how much money you have in the bank, and how many people are in your  family. You will have to give proof of how much you make. The government will ask  to speak to your boss, see your bank statements and proof that you pay taxes.
 If you qualify, you will probably be put on a waiting list. Section 8, like other  public housing programs, has many people applying for them. You could be waiting  many years before you actually get a voucher, which is like a coupon that says how  much rent the government is willing to pay for you. If a landlord accepts you and  your Section 8 voucher, you still have to sign a lease, or rental contract.
100. BASEBALL: THE NATIONAL PASTIME  The game of baseball in the United States is the oldest major league sport in the  country. Major League Baseball traces its roots back to the 1880s, but the game had  been enjoyed by Americans for decades before then. The origins of the game are in  question. For many years a 19th Century American named Abner Doubleday was  credited with creating the game, but this has been proven inaccurate today.
 One theory is that the game was brought across the Atlantic Ocean during the  great European migration of the 18th Century, and that it is based on the British  game of cricket. Cricket is a very popular sport in England, but it is played by mostly  the upper-class members of that society, and it is unlikely that the poor immigrants  from England played the game very much. However, it more closely resembles the  game of rounders, which is another English sport that shares many common features  as the American game of baseball.
 In any event, the game became very popular in the United States. By the 20th  Century, the American League, and the National League were taking the country by  storm. The greatest single team in either league's history is the New York Yankees.
 The Yankees have won more World Series titles than any other team in history.
 The World Series is a seven-game competition with the two top teams from either  league. The first team to win four games is declared the World Series Champion. In  1903, The Boston Americans won the first World Series beating the Pittsburgh  Pirates. This was the start of an annual series matchup between the two leagues. To  date, the Yankees have won 27 championships in 40 appearances, with the team's  most recent title coming in 2009. The St. Louis Cardinals lead the National League  with 11 titles in 19 appearances, with its last title coming in 2011.
101. SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THEME PARKS  Disneyland, or the Magic Kingdom, as some people call it, opened in 1955, and by  doing so became the first major theme park attraction in Southern California. Its  success spawned many other parks in the region and throughout the country. Walt  Disney World opened 16 years later in Orlando, Florida, as part of a much larger  complex that includes the Epcot Center, the Disney Animal Kingdom, and the Disney  Hollywood Studios, but for many years, it was just Disneyland in Southern California.
 Then came Knott's Berry Farm in Buena Park, California, just a stone's throw away  from Disneyland.
 Knott's touts itself as "America's 1st Theme Park," and technically it is, but its  beginnings are not like Disneyland. Knott's was originally a place where local  residents could buy berries and preserves. It did not become a major theme park  attraction until well after Disneyland was built. Nevertheless, it is today one of the  favorite attractions for both young and old visitors to the region. The park features  world-class roller coaster rides, and shows. It also has an annual Halloween themed  night called "Fright Night," which has become a very popular attraction in the past 20  years.
 Another famous theme park in the L.A. area is Magic Mountain, which is located in  Valencia, California, just a few miles north of the Los Angeles basin. It also features  world-class rides and attractions, and has been featured in several Hollywood films,  including the original vacation movie with Chevy Chase. These three parks form the  core of Southern California-based theme parks, but there are more theme parks in  the region including Legoland, Sea World, Universal Studios, and the California  Adventure next to Disneyland. These are just some of the major attractions  Americans can visit to have a good time in Southern California.
102. THE LOS ANGELES MEMORIAL COLISEUM  One of the great Los Angeles landmarks is the Memorial Coliseum. The coliseum  was first commissioned in 1921, and completed in 1923. The original seating capacity  was more than 75,000 seats, and was built as a memorial to World War I veterans. It  has since been rededicated as a memorial for all American veterans from all wars. It  is a historic stadium, and arguably the most famous outdoor sports arena in the  country. Los Angeles was picked by the International Olympic Committee to host the  1932 Olympics. The city leaders realized the stadium was too small, and began a  major renovation. It is the only stadium to have hosted two modern Olympic games  in the world, but it is much more than that.
 The coliseum has also played host to other major league sporting events. It was  the site of the 1959 World Series between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Chicago  White Sox. It played host to the original Super Bowl game in 1967 between the  Green Bay Packers and the Kansas City Chiefs. The game was not called the Super  Bowl at the time. It was known as the First AFL-NFL World Championship Game. It  started what is now the largest annual sporting event in the country, if not the world.
 Baseball was king during those years, and was, and is still called the Great American  Pastime. The stadium is home to the University of Southern California Trojan football  team, which is one of the most historic college teams in the history of the sport. It  also was the home field of the UCLA Bruin football team for a number of years. In  1984, the city of Los Angeles and the Coliseum played host to the XXIII Olympic  Games, becoming the only stadium to hold that honor. The stadium has played host  to World Cup games, boxing matches, and countless concerts, and outdoor events. It  is an American tradition that lives on today.
103. THE LAND OF MOBILE DINING  There are many traditional restaurants in the Los Angeles area that offer first-rate  dining experiences, but one of the recent trends moving through the city is mobile  food trucks. Mobile food trucks, or catering trucks, were formerly seen mostly at  places of business. Some businesses that had a large number of employees  contracted with these trucks to bring food to the company's site to provide breakfast  and lunch. It was an alternative choice for many workers who preferred to stay close  to work at lunch time.
 The catering truck industry began getting very competitive as food truck  operators became more commonplace. The way to ensure companies would continue  doing business with their food trucks, caterers had to diversify their menu items to  become more appealing to their customers. Soon catering trucks became specialized  eateries offering foods ranging from tacos and burritos to hamburgers and hotdogs,  and more exotic foods.
 One of the most famous catering trucks is the Kogi truck. Los Angeles is home to  hundreds of different cultures and the Kogi truck is a marriage of Mexican and Korean  cuisine. People drive for miles to eat a Kogi Kimchi Quesadilla, or a famous spicy  pork, or tofu taco. Kogi burritos are just as tasty and exotic. The short rib burrito is  one of the favorite items on the menu. Kogi is just one example of the diversity in  mobile dining available in Southern California.
 Today, the food truck industry is growing larger and larger. Many operators have  their own websites so that their customers can see beforehand where they will be  parked for the day. The days when catering trucks served only businesses are now  over, although they still do catering to businesses, an entire new branch of trucks has  hit the streets of Los Angeles.
104. VENICE BEACH AND BOARDWALK  Nestled adjacent to the city of Los Angeles lies Venice Beach and boardwalk,  which is officially the Venice Ocean Front Walk. The beach and boardwalk are major  tourist attractions to Southern California visitors, and vacationers. With its nearly  year-round warm temperature, light rainfall, and cool sandy beaches, locals and  visitors alike take to the streets of Venice to enjoy a day in the sun.
 Venice Beach is famous for its Muscle Beach section. This is where men and  women come from all parts of the country to work out in the California sunshine on  the boardwalk. It has been featured in many Hollywood films, and is a popular tourist  attraction on its own. The boardwalk is also home to various shops and restaurants,  along with numerous street performers, artists, musicians, and even fortune tellers.
 There are unique homes alongside the boardwalk and beachfront that feature some  of the more exotic designs found in the country.
 Visitors can enjoy a day at the beach and boardwalk in a number of ways. The  boardwalk accommodates bike riders, skateboarders, and rollerbladers. The beach  offers traditional surfing, parasailing, body surfing, and swimming all year round. Its  outdoor restaurants offer some of the best cuisine found in the city. Venice Beach and  boardwalk are perfect examples of California cool, with its tanned bodies, eccentric  lifestyles, and colorful characters.
 The surrounding community features stylish boutiques, cafes, art galleries, and  bars for a fun night on the town. With its year-round great weather, palm trees, white  sand beaches, parks, and attractions, the Venice Beach and boardwalk area has  become a world destination that defines California. The region is in the midst of a  healthy living trend that is affecting the entire country. With its outdoor weight training areas, a jogging, and bike path, Venice beach is the place to be.
105. THE LA BREA TAR PITS  There is perhaps no other place on earth like the La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles,  California. The tar pits are located on Wilshire Blvd in the heart of the city, and offer a  snapshot into life in the city of L.A. 10,000 years ago. The George C. Page museum  was built around the tar pits specifically to research the ancient attraction.
 Located in the Hancock Park district of L.A., the tar pits are a continuous flow  from deep inside the earth's crust that frequently uncovers prehistoric animals that  were caught in the tar. Many of these animals' remains are on exhibit at the Page  Museum, and excavation of new fossils is an ongoing process. The site is registered  as a National Natural Landmark by the U.S. government.
 In 2009, the Page Museum, which is part of L.A.'s Natural History Museum,  announced the discovery of 16 fossil deposits in 2006 unearthed during the  construction of an underground parking garage. A saber-toothed cat, six dire wolves,  a bison, horses, giant sloth, and an American lion were among the animals  discovered. A nearly complete mammoth was also unearthed at that time. The  artifacts are now part of the Page Museum exhibit, and museum officials are certain  there are more fossils to be found under the streets of L.A.
 The museum is a major attraction to visitors to L.A., and is a primary science  attraction for schools, clubs and other organizations interested in the past. It is a  piece of living history that is in a constant state of change because of new  discoveries. It is a good place to spend a leisurely afternoon in the City of Angels,  which is open all year round.
106. SPACE SHUTTLE ENDEAVOUR  The space shuttle program in the United States traces its beginning back to the  mid-1970s when the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) decided  to create a fleet of reusable orbiters. The first shuttle manufactured was the  Enterprise, which was named after the Star Trek, starship from the 1960s television  series. The first orbiting shuttle, Columbia, was launched into space in April 1981.
 The last mission to space for the shuttle program was carried out by the shuttle  Atlantis in July 2011. In all, six orbiters were built including the shuttle Endeavour,  which can be seen today at the California Science Center in Los Angeles, California.
 More than 20 organizations throughout the country petitioned to become home to  the retired shuttle in 2012, but Los Angeles gained the prize. Transporting such a  huge and complex machine was no easy task. It landed at the Los Angeles  International Airport on September 12, 2012, and three weeks later began its  journey through the streets of L.A. to the California Science Center in Exposition  Park.
 The orbiter encountered a few problems during its 12-mile journey, and it drew  thousands of spectators to the streets to catch a glimpse of the giant spacecraft.
 Endeavour required a police escort through temporarily closed streets. More than 400  oak trees were cut down to clear the path for the shuttle; power lines and telephone  poles had to be removed to accommodate the behemoth. Endeavour also had  difficulty crossing bridges throughout the city, but in the end, the shuttle reached its  final destination.
 Today, the Endeavour exhibit can be seen at the Samuel Oschin Pavilion at the  California Science Center in Los Angeles. It is a piece of American history that is a  must-see attraction to all visitors to the greater Los Angeles area.
107. THE DEMOLITION DERBY  Many Americans grew up watching Demolition Derby events. The derby is a show  in which drivers ram their vehicles into one another for demolition dominance. The  object of the contest is to disable your competitor's vehicle before it stops yours. It is  an exciting attraction that appeals to Americans of all ages.
 When Mark attended his first derby as a young boy, he was mesmerized by the  action on the track. Demolition derbies are usually held in outlying areas where there  is plenty of room to compete. Most derbies are in an arena, but one of the attractions  of the sport is that derbies can be held just about anywhere. After watching his first  match, Mark told his dad, "I'm going to be a derby driver one day, dad." His father  just chuckled, but encouraged his son.
 Mark got his chance last year when he drove his orange, 1978 Mustang in the  Riverside County Fair's derby for the first time. The competition he entered featured  10 cars, and was as exciting as he thought it would be. He didn't win his first  competition, but he got valuable experience, and is looking forward to next year's  event. "I don't give up easily," Mark told his dad.
 Demolition derbies got their start in New York in 1947 when former stock car  racer Larry Mendelsohn realized that many people liked watching crashes more than  racing. He began staging his derbies and they soon became popular at fairs and  festivals. There are few rules involved with driving in a derby. Drivers can use any  part of their cars to ram into other vehicles to disable them. The only rule is drivers  cannot hit the driver side door where the driver sits. Most competitors use the rear  portion of their vehicles to ram others, so as not to disable their own motors.
 Demolition derbies are a true American creation.
108. CALIFORNIA'S EARTHQUAKES  One of the main reasons for California's beauty is the tectonic plate movement  beneath the surface of the state. This movement is responsible for some of  California's breathtaking mountain ranges and deep valleys. California is part of a  large area of land called the Ring of Fire that surrounds the Pacific Ocean. It is a  hotbed of volcanic activity and earthquakes.
 California has had its share of earthquakes over the years. The most famous was  the Great San Francisco earthquake of 1906. The city was completely unprepared for  an earthquake of this magnitude. The quake was estimated to measure 7.8 on the  Richter scale. More than 80 percent of the city was destroyed, and an estimated  3,000 people lost their lives.
 San Francisco was again hit by a large earthquake in October 1989. The Loma  Prieta quake measured 6.9 on the Richter scale, and occurred during the World  Series, an annual championship series of baseball. Although the loss of life was  minimal compared with other quakes, it had a profound effect on the transportation  system in the city.
 Southern California has suffered its share of quakes also. In 1971, the region was  hit in Sylmar, just north of Los Angeles; in 1994, the area was devastated in the  Northridge quake. Other smaller, but none-the-less frightening, and dangerous  quakes have plagued both regions.
 Because of these disasters, building codes have improved greatly. This has helped  minimize the number of deaths suffered from these quakes. Furthermore, engineers  are constantly at work to improve buildings. Americans have the ability, knowledge,  and determination to survive and thrive in the face of danger.
109. FREE SUMMER FUN  Summer time in the United States generally means people have a lot more free  time to enjoy the outdoors. The sun is out for longer, so there are more hours in the  day to enjoy. Having more free time does not mean you need to spend a lot of  money. There are plenty of ways to enjoy your city or town for little or no money.
 In the summer, many parks offer free concerts. Sometimes these concerts feature  bands and musicians that are well known. Other times the concerts are given by up  and coming artists. Regardless of whether you know the band playing or not, these  free concerts in the park are a great way to enjoy music outdoors. If you arrive at the  park early with your friends, you can even have a picnic.
 Many parks also offer free outdoor screenings of movies. It's always a good idea  to arrive early to get a good viewing spot. Being too close to the movie screen is no  fun; your neck will hurt. Sitting too far means you'll have to squint. These outdoor  movie screenings are also great for picnics.
 If theater is more of your thing, most major cities have some Shakespeare-in-the park programs. These programs feature different works of Shakespeare performed  live and outdoors. Many of these programs are free. Some of these Shakespeare-in the-park programs are so popular that people line up for hours to get free tickets.
 Usually the tickets are first come, first serve. If all the tickets run out before you get  to the front of the line, then you are out of luck. So get there early!
 If you don't have air conditioning, many museums offer free admission days or  hours. Besides the museums being cool temperature wise, they are also cool because  you can see amazing works of art.
110. PAYING YOUR FARE  Different public transit systems across the United States have different rules and  procedures for paying the fare. Children under a certain age or below a certain height  sometimes can ride for free or for a lower fare; the elderly and disabled usually ride  for a discounted price.
 Most mass transit buses accept cash fares; almost all buses accept coins.
 However, a passenger has to have exact change because bus drivers do not make  change. Some buses accept tokens that you can buy at some bus depots or train  stations. Across the country, more and more buses use a fare card system. These are  cards loaded by passengers with a certain amount of money; it could be a day, week,  month or annual pass. They are swiped, tapped, or scanned when riding. The fare is  automatically deducted. What is good about a fare card is that they can be reloaded  via the Internet or by phone, so a passenger doesn't need to go to a station to add  money. Fare cards also make transferring from one bus line to another easier. Many  cities even allow for free transfers from one bus line to another when using a fare  card.
 Light rails, subways, and trains usually have a similar system of paying your fare.
 However, people cannot pay to ride using cash since there is no one there to collect  the fare. Most rail-based mass transit systems require a token or a fare card. Many  rail systems have turnstiles that are locked until you swipe or tap your fare card.
 Some people do not like fare cards because they worry about where they are going  being tracked.
111. LIBRARY RESOURCES  Most people think that their local city or county public library is just a place to  borrow books. The truth is that modern public libraries are for more than just  reading. Libraries are also places for music, movies, and other forms of  entertainment. Most libraries today have compact discs and DVDs for people to  borrow, just like they borrow books. If people don't want to pay for a subscription for  a specific newspaper or magazine, libraries also usually have copies for people to  read at their local branch or to borrow and take home to read.
 While some people worry that paper books and periodicals are going out of  fashion because of digital technology, libraries are using tech to their advantage.
 Most public library systems now offer electronic versions of books for patrons to  download. These downloads are good for a limited time, just like when someone  borrows a physical book from the library. A patron can download these e-books  directly to their tablets or e-readers.
 For those who like a more audio experience, many libraries also offer audiobooks,  and mp3 music downloads. These downloads are also usually for a limited time, but  just like when borrowing books, they are free. Libraries also increasingly offer movies  for their patrons to borrow digitally.
 Libraries are also great places to socialize. Many libraries have clubs and meetings  that cater to a wide variety of interests. There are knitting clubs, lectures on different  topics, and of course, reading and writing clubs.
 For those looking to better themselves, many public libraries offer resources.
 There is tutoring for students from elementary school through college. There are  classes for those who want to practice their English or become U.S. citizens. There  are even workshops to help people create resumes, find jobs, and prepare for  interviews.
112. FINDING A JOB IN CALIFORNIA  Finding a job in California is not an easy task. One of the most important factors  in finding a job is having completed a course of study in college. This is not as easy  as it may sound. Many young people have not found their field of interest. Some go  to college simply because their parents want them to.
 A degree from an institution of higher learning will definitely increase employment  opportunities for most people. However, there are numerous professions available to  people that do not have a degree. To help these people find jobs, the state of  California has an Employment Development Department that is dedicated to helping  people find jobs. The EDD has offices located throughout the state. Many of these  offices have Work Source centers, where a person can visit, and use EDD computers  to find jobs, and meet with employment representatives.
 Other resources available to job seekers are employment agencies. Employment  agencies work closely with companies of all sizes to help fill the needs of these  companies. The agencies serve as pre-screeners for these companies, some of which  may not have the resources to handle new hires. Some of these agencies seek  specific people to fill specific jobs, while others help anyone who comes into the  office.
 Internships are another way for people to gain employment. Interns are not paid  for their work, or are paid very little. The purpose of an internship is for the company  to see first-hand how a person works before hiring them. By using this method,  employers gain insight into the workers' character and work ethic. Interns gain  valuable experience they can use for future jobs.
113. THE BACKYARD BARBEQUE  The backyard barbeque is one of the great American traditions. The first day of  summer is June 21, and that date signals the start of the summer grilling season. In  places like Southern California, it rarely rains during the summer. Residents of this  region get very little tropical conditions during this time. The heat is dry, much like a  desert. This means it is a good time to invite friends, neighbors, family, and co workers to enjoy a summer feast.
 Barbeque grills vary greatly in type and size. Some people prefer the propane  fueled grills, or a natural gas grill, while others prefer the old-fashioned charcoal  briquettes. Of course, there are still grillers who like natural wood-burning grills.
 Along with the food, grilling outdoors is a social setting. People get together to  have beverages and food, and get caught up with the latest happenings. It's a great  way to meet new people and to network with others while having a great time.
 Additionally, many people bring their children along, and they have fun playing with  each other.
 The main attraction though is the food. Grillers love experimenting with new  spices and sauces to enhance the flavor of their favorite meats. Ribs and chicken are  very popular menu items. People can cook just about anything on a grill, such as  warming tortillas, toasting bread, grilling onions, corn, and fish. One of the best  things about a backyard barbeque afternoon is the wonderful smell of grilling food  that carries through the air.
 The tradition is especially true on holidays such as the Fourth of July, and  Veterans Day, but celebrants do not need an excuse to grill outdoors. All they need is  a grill, food, and good company to have a good time.
114. THE BLENDED FAMILY  A blended family is a family where one parent has children that are not  biologically related to the other parent. The most famous blended family in American  popular culture is the Brady Bunch. The Brady Bunch was a U.S. television show that  ran from the 1960s into the 1970s. It featured a widowed father, Mr. Brady, who was  left to raise three sons. Mr. Brady ends up marrying a woman who has three  daughters of her own from a previous relationship. Both adults in the family end up  helping to raise children that are not theirs biologically. Half of the children are  stepchildren, although all the children call Mr. and Mrs. Brady  When the television show first came out, it was controversial. Prior to the Brady  Bunch, most television families were traditional ones, which means a man married a  woman and together they raised their children. However, now blended families are  seen as normal. Not only do people remarry after a spouse has died, as in the  television show. People remarry after getting divorced. These remarried couples often  have their own children. Increasingly, many blended families are not even legally  married. More and more couples live together without getting married.
 Blended families happen because divorce and remarriage can be more  complicated than what is seen on television. The Bradys, as widows, didn't have to  worry about visitation rights. In some blended families, children live part of the time  with one parent. Sometimes one parent sees his or her children only on weekends or  during school vacations. The Brady family also didn't worry about child support  payments.
 The most common type of blended family is a mother with children from a  previous relationship starts a new relationship with a man. This is because usually the  mother has custody of the children.
115. KEEPING A DIARY FOR YOUR HEALTH  Many people think that keeping a diary is something that teenage girls do. It's  seen as a space to write down who you have a crush on, a place to write down  secrets, things you don't want anyone else to know. The stereotype is that only  women keep diaries. In fact, your diary doesn't have to have pink flowers on it.
 Keeping a diary, also called a journal, is a very old tradition. It can be useful for many  different kinds of people. Many famous people have kept diaries. Many powerful  people have kept diaries. Some of these people include famous writers and even  presidents.
 Keeping a journal is said to have health benefits. It improves not just mental and  emotional health, but also physical health. Studies show that keeping a diary, that is,  writing out thoughts daily, can decrease asthma and arthritis symptoms. Writing uses  your left brain, which is analytical and rational. While your left brain is busy, your  right brain is free to create and feel. This removes mental blocks and allows you to  use all of your brain power to better understand yourself, others, and the world  around you.
 The key to successful diary keeping is not editing, which means not stopping any  thoughts from coming through. This even means allowing thoughts that disturb you  to come out in your writing. It helps clarify your feelings, and is especially useful if a  person is faced with a hard decision. Sometimes just writing down the pros and cons  help you better understand an issue. You begin to see a problem from different  angles. This is helpful if you are having a disagreement with others.
116. SANTA ANITA RACE TRACK  Horse racing is an American tradition dating back to the country's beginnings. In  Southern California, there are a variety of tracks, including Santa Anita, Del Mar, Los  Alamitos, and the Fairplex. Santa Anita Park is located in Arcadia, California, just a  few miles northeast of Los Angeles. The track features thoroughbred horse racing,  and is one of the premier tracks in the country. It is located near the base of the San  Gabriel Mountains, and is known for its beautiful scenery. Many important races are  run yearly, including the Santa Anita Derby and the Santa Anita Handicap. It has also  played host to six Breeder's Cup races since 1986.
 The park features a one-mile racing track, a 26,000 capacity grandstand to  accommodate visitors, 61 barns and more than 2,000 horses. It has an infield park  inside the track that can accommodate an additional 50,000 spectators. The infield is  one of the most attractive features the park has to offer. It is a setting where people  can bring their own food, drinks, chairs, and blankets to enjoy a leisurely day betting  on the horses, or just picnicking. It is a beautiful setting for both adults, and children.
 Not every visitor to the park is a bettor, though. Many people come to Santa Anita  just to enjoy the atmosphere, good weather, and food.
 There are various ways to bet on a horse at Santa Anita, or at any racetrack. The  most common is to bet a horse to win a race. Bettors can also bet on a horse to come  in second, which is called to place, or to come in third, called show. Additionally,  bettors can place a bet for a horse to win, place, or show, which means a person is  betting a horse that will come in at least third. There are other methods for betting,  including the Daily Double, where a bettor tries to pick the winner of two horse races  that are established by the track. Pick Six is another popular betting venue. In this  bet, a bettor picks the winner of six races, which is very difficult, but the payout is  substantial.
117. MINIATURE GOLF  One favorite activity for young people in Southern California is visiting a Golf  Arcade. The main feature of this attraction is playing miniature golf, which is, as the  name suggests, a smaller version of the game of golf. In golf, players play a round of  golf that includes either 9, or 18 holes in an open, park-like field where each hole is a  great distance from the other. Golfers use a variety of clubs to play a round of golf,  including a driver, an iron, and a putter. Each club has its own use. The object of the  game is to put a golf ball into the hole in the least number of strokes.
 In miniature golf, the course is much smaller. Golf arcades are usually contained  within a one-block area, so the game differs greatly from golf. One club is all it takes  to play miniature golf, but it is no less fun than playing real golf. A miniature golf  course has many themes depending on which course a person visits. Unlike golf,  miniature golf has obstacles placed in the path of the golf ball to make it difficult for a  person to put the ball in the hole. Miniature golf is usually no more than nine holes.
 Golf arcades are not limited to playing miniature golf. Some arcades include mini car racing on a small, professional-like race track. It is fun to test a person's skills  against others in a mini-car race. If racing is not something of interest, there are  other activities available. Video games and pinball are popular. The food is another  attraction at golf arcades. Most golf arcades serve American favorites like hot dogs,  hamburgers, and pizza with all the trimmings. A golf arcade is really a great way to  spend a Friday, or Saturday night.
118. WORKING OUT IN L.A.
 One of the major trends happening today in the United States is physical fitness.
 For many years, Americans led the world in deaths due to heart disease related to  obesity. America is a society on the move; so many people do not take the time to  eat properly. What happens in a typical day is that Americans turn to fast food  restaurants whenever they are in a rush. Some of the more popular fast food  restaurants are McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's, Jack-in-the-Box, Carl's Jr., and  White Castle. All these places offer a quick bite to eat at an economical price.
 However, the quality of the food has been suspected for years.
 The fitness craze began as early as the 1970s, when people became aware that  the fast food giants were serving food that promoted obesity. Coupled with beverage  industry companies like Coca Cola, Pepsi, and 7UP, Americans were consuming too  much salt in their food, and too much sugar in their beverages. Having realized the  problem, Americans began making healthier eating choices. Those companies have  also made major adjustments in the food they offer. Today, along with the old menu  items such as hamburgers, fries, and sodas, the fast food restaurants now offer  grilled chicken sandwiches and salads, too.
 More Americans exercise on a regular basis these days, which helps promote a  healthy metabolism and improve stamina. It also helps control blood pressure and  blood sugar levels. Because of the healthy eating and exercise trends going on in  America today, death rate has been reduced significantly. Most Americans grew up on  fried, greasy food, but more and more people are making the right food choices.
 Americans are adaptable people.
119. SUNSET BOULEVARD AND HOLLYWOOD  Sunset Boulevard, one of the world famous streets, is located in the city of Los  Angeles, and runs through the Hollywood district. Hollywood is a section of L.A. being  home to the movie industry. Sunset Blvd has been featured in many Hollywood  movies with the most famous being the chase scene in the movie "Bullitt." In the  movie, the late actor, Steve McQueen, drives a 1968 Ford Mustang through the  streets of Hollywood in a high-speed chase that was the defining moment of the  movie. The movie was selected for preservation in the U.S. National Film Registry as  being culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant of American culture.
 The boulevard makes its way through Hollywood and continues on through the  streets of Beverly Hills, which is another world famous city. It has a number of high end shops, where the rich and famous can be seen. At the western end of the street,  people will find the Pacific Ocean. It has a breath-taking view that is very popular  with both tourists and local residents. Sunset Blvd is also a late-night cruising spot.
 Young people like to take to Sunset Blvd on weekend nights to see the sights, or to  meet new people. Along with all the shops, there are many nightclubs that feature  the latest music.
 Just north of Sunset Blvd lies Hollywood Blvd, which is a major tourist attraction.
 One of the greatest features of Hollywood Blvd is the Walk of Fame, which  distinguishes Hollywood Blvd from any other street in the country. It features  memorial plaques embedded into the cement on the sidewalk. The plagues are stars  with names of famous movie actors and actresses, from the past to the present. It is  considered a great honor to have a star on streets of Hollywood.
120. CATALINA ISLAND  Twenty-two miles off the coast of Southern California lies Santa Catalina Island.
 The island is referred to as simply Catalina Island, or just Catalina. It is an isolated  island with fewer than 5,000 residents, and most of them live in its only incorporated  city, Avalon. It is part of a group of islands called the Channel Islands of California.
 The climate on the island is typically Southern Californian with warm temperatures all  year round. Catalina Island has a rich history that dates back to the 16th Century  when Spanish explorers visited the island. Archaeological evidence indicates that  Native American tribes occupied the island centuries before that. The island had been  a possession of Mexico, and eventually of the United States.
 There are two common ways to get to the island today. Most people travel to  Catalina by boat from either Orange or Los Angeles County points. Helicopter rides  are also available for more daring travelers. The island today is a tourist attraction  that features island tours, sport fishing, scuba diving, surfing, parasailing, and  beachcombing. In past years, the island was a hotspot for the Hollywood rich and  famous. Glass-bottom boat tours are available for those interested in exploring the  reef system or the shipwrecks in the region. The underwater dive park is also a  popular attraction for visitors.
 Catalina Island is also famous, or perhaps infamous, as the location where actress  Natalie Wood died in the waters off the island's coast. The controversial death  occurred more than 30 years ago while Wood and her husband, actor Robert Wagner,  were sailing their yacht. Her death is still controversial today.
121. TONYA HARDING AND NANCY KERRIGAN  Tonya Harding is the notorious American figure skater who made headlines in  1994 by attacking her skating competitor Nancy Kerrigan. During a practice session  for the 1994 United States Figure Skating Championships, Harding and her ex husband hired her husband's friend to physically assault Kerrigan. The attack was  intended to improve Harding's chances to make the Olympic team, which she did.
 The plan was to break Kerrigan's leg, but was not successful. Kerrigan only suffered  severe bruising. She was also part of the Olympic team in Lillehammer, Norway.
 When it was discovered that Harding was behind the attack, a media frenzy  ensued. Kerrigan was on the cover of both Time, and Newsweek in January 1994. The  media descended onto the Olympic city in great numbers, and the video of the  competition became one of the most watched shows in American history. The  following month, Harding's husband cooperated with authorities by testifying against  Harding and her co-conspirators in a plea-bargaining agreement. Harding was banned  from competing for life by the United States Figure Skating Association after pleading  guilty for her part of the attack on March 16, 1994. By pleading guilty, she was able  to avoid a jail sentence.
 Harding remained in the American limelight for several years following the  incident. Her ex-husband released a wedding sex video of Harding and himself. Some  of those images were published by Penthouse Magazine. She competed in a Fox TV  network broadcast of Celebrity Boxing in 2002. She went on to try a professional  boxing career the following year, but with little success. Kerrigan, on the other hand,  fell out of the American culture scene, never to be heard of again.
122. COUCH POTATOES  More and more people in the United States are becoming couch potatoes. This  doesn't mean that they are turning into a root that can be cooked and eaten. The  actual potato is a lot more useful than a person who sits on their sofa watching  television or playing video games. One of the reasons why obesity rates are going up  in the country is because more and more entertainment is available on television.
 Now television is not just for watching shows, people can watch movies, play video  games, and even surf the Internet. Potatoes and sofas have other things in common,  too. When most people are on their couches interacting with television, they are also  often eating snacks like potato chips. This is why so many people in the United States  are overweight.
 Being a couch potato can have other health risks besides weight gain. Because  more and more people are sitting in front of a television screen or even a computer  screen, they aren't engaging in other physical activities like exercising. This is one  reason why heart disease is a leading cause of death in the country. Another problem  caused by this lack of exercise and increased screen time is weakness in muscles.
 There is an impact on people's mental and emotional health, too. Sitting inside in  front of a screen usually means a person is spending less time interacting with friends  and loved ones. This can lead to isolation, depression, and anxiety.
 Being a couch potato is not just for adults. More and more kids are being targeted  by television and the Internet. This is why more and more children have weight associated health problems. This is why the White House has programs like Let's  Move, encouraging kids to engage in physical activity.
123. THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY FAIR  Every August and September, the Los Angeles County Fair takes center stage at  the Fairplex facility in Pomona, California. This year, the fair runs from August 29 to  Sept. 28, and will feature various attractions for the entire family. Going to a county  fair is as American as apple pie. It was once a main attraction for rural Americans  who lived far away from big cities. The traveling fair was a huge event at that time as  it only came once a year. People would wait the entire year for the fair to come to  their town, and many of them participated in it.
 The L.A. County Fair is one of the largest fairs in the country. It features just  about every kind of farm animals around. Parents can take their children to the  petting zoos, where kids can pet lambs, piglets, calves, and foals. Additionally, people  can bring home pets from the fair that include such exotic animals like snakes,  rodents, and even tarantulas.
 Other attractions include the barnyard races that feature piglets racing around a  track at breakneck speeds. There are several game booths, and a carnival that has  some of the most exciting and thrilling rides in the region. This year the fair will  introduce an exhibit that demonstrates how life was for early Californians, and a  wilderness show. The wilderness show focuses on appreciating the natural beauty of  the state, and how people today can preserve its beauty for future generations. The  fair also stages several concerts on weekend nights from some of the top performers  in the music industry.
 Of course, the main attraction the fair has to offer is the food. Here people can  enjoy food that is only offered at the fair. One favorite is the chocolate-covered bacon  treat. It is a place for those with hearty appetites. Almost any food that can be deep 124. BILINGUAL IS BETTER  Learning a second language is hard, but it is better for your brain. While many  people learn another language because of their cultural or ethnic heritage, it also  helps your thinking. Studies show that people who speak two or more languages  score higher on IQ tests. Speaking two or more languages also prevents your brain  from aging. This means when you get older your chances of having Alzheimer's  disease are small.
 It's better and easier to become bilingual when you are younger. When you are a  child, your brain is like a sponge absorbing information quickly. However, learning a  second or even third language at any age is good brain exercise. Being bilingual  boosts your memory and listening skills.
 Being bilingual also helps your chances of finding a job. So many companies in a  variety of fields now work around the globe. They need workers who can  communicate with all their clients worldwide. Knowing more than one language  usually means you are a better multitasker. In today's fast-paced business world,  being able to do more than one thing at a time is seen as a plus. Some companies  may even pay bilingual workers more. This is why it's a good idea to put your  language skills on your resume. There are also social benefits to being bilingual. Most  people who are bilingual are more open-minded and culturally sensitive compared to  those who only know one language.
 Being bilingual or even multilingual is controversial, though. Some parents worry  that switching among different languages will confuse their children. Some people  feel that in the United States everyone should speak English only. There are even  organizations asking the U.S. Congress to pass laws making it illegal for the  government to use any other language on official documents. This movement has not  been very successful.
125. CASEY ANTHONY: AMERICA'S MOST HATED WOMAN  Casey Anthony's story has many similarities to the O.J. Simpson case. Both  people are generally thought to have gotten away with murder. In 2011, Anthony  topped the list of most hated Americans, and today she is still in the top five of that  same list. This all stems from the results of a 2011 murder trial, where Anthony was  acquitted of killing her two-year-old daughter. As in the O.J. Simpson trial, public  opinion was highly in want of a guilty charge. All evidence seemed to point to  Anthony as the guilty person. To this day, Americans still feel the justice system did  not work in this case.
 Anthony's daughter Caylee was born on August 9, 2005, but the day of her death  remains unknown. It is simply listed as 2008. The reason for this is because the exact  time and date of her death was never determined. Caylee Anthony was last seen  alive on June 16, 2008, but it wasn't until July 15 that her grandmother reported her  missing. A total of 30 days passed from the time Casey Anthony reported leaving her  daughter at a babysitter's house to the time Caylee was reported missing. During  that time period, Casey was seen enjoying the nightlife in Southern Florida. Many  photos exist of her partying away while her daughter was missing. The public  perceived this behavior as unnatural for a caring, loving mother.
 When Casey was asked of her daughter's whereabouts, the lies began. Casey said  she had left her daughter at a babysitter's house, which was not true. She also lied  several times to the police about where her daughter was. However, a forensic  scientist concluded that a smell coming from Casey's trunk was decomposing flesh.
 Casey was convicted of lying to the police, and other charges, but she was acquitted  in the murder trial despite the evidence against her. Today she is free, but lives in  hiding for fear of retaliation.
126. THE STAR WARS PHENOMENON  Star Wars is an American movie franchise that was first seen in 1977. It is  possibly the most popular movie franchise in the history of the film industry. Although  the stories took place thousands of years ago, the technology shown was more  advanced than anything on earth today. It is spectacular! The space vehicles alone  can travel between galaxies in the Universe, which is far beyond our present-day  technology. The worlds depicted are pure fantasy, and are very popular with people of  all ages.
 Star Wars was originally a low-budget film that almost did not make it to the big  screen. Its creator had a hard time selling the idea to the large Hollywood studios,  and was turned away several times before it was finally picked up. The franchise has  become one of the most lucrative series of films in the history of Hollywood. It has  spawned several offshoot products such as video games, comic books, short stories,  clothing, and toys.
 The storylines are very simple. They all focus on good versus evil. The main  characters have endeared themselves to the American public over the decades. Some  of these characters are everlasting because of their dedication to good, and their  continual struggle against the forces of evil. Star Wars was a pioneer film series that  has been copied, but never with the skill of its original creator.
 Most Americans know these films very well and many of them grew up watching  the franchise. The first film in the third set of movies is due to debut in 2015. It is  becoming one of the most anticipated new movies in history. It is currently in pre production, and will undoubtedly create an entire new generation of Star Wars fans in  years to come.
127. STAR TREK  The Star Trek franchise is one of the largest and most successful franchises in the  entertainment industry. Unlike Star Wars, which is a very popular movie franchise,  Star Trek crosses both film and television boundaries. Star Trek precedes Star Wars  by about 10 years, having been developed in the mid-1960s for television.
 The original Star Trek series was a ground-breaking show that addressed many  sensitive issues that existed in the 60s. The show featured a multi-cultural cast that  included white, black, Asian, and female actors. This was unheard of in the 60s.
 During that time period, nearly all shows on American TV had only white cast  members. The few minority actors in these shows usually had minor roles that  depicted them as gardeners, butlers, outlaws, or misfits. For the first time in  television history, minority members of society had positive role models depicted on  TV. This diversity led, in large part, to the popularity of Star Trek.
 The original series ran for only three seasons, but gained a large fan base in the  years following its cancellation in 1969. It spawned many future series. In all, there  have been five television series and 11 films in the Star Trek franchise, which is  nearly twice the number of Star War films to date.
 Some of the issues covered in the original series were racism, homosexuality,  gender bias, religion, and drugs. The series developers did not shy away from these  important social issues. The original creator of the series had a difficult time selling  his show to the networks because of this. TV executives felt American viewers were  not ready to bring these issues into their homes, but the series became very  successful soon after it was launched.
128. THE NUCLEAR BOMBING OF JAPAN  The United States is the first and only country to use nuclear weapons in the  history of the world. These attacks came in August, 1945, during the final stages of  World War II against the Empire of Japan. Two cities targeted by the U.S. were  Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The war in Europe was over in May of that year, with Nazi  Germany's surrender, but the Japanese carried on. The U.S. and its allies conducted a  firebombing campaign against the Japanese. It devastated the country, but they  would not surrender. The allies were looking at a costly campaign to invade the  Japanese mainland. The Japanese were determined to fight to the last person to  defend their country, if necessary. This was a major factor in the decision to use the  atomic bomb.
 The U.S., along with China and the United Kingdom, called for Japan's surrender  in July 1945 with a threat of devastation, but Japan refused. On August 9, the first  bomb was dropped on the city of Hiroshima. Nicknamed "Little Boy," the bomb killed  approximately 90,000 to 170,000 Japanese citizens. The blast completely destroyed  the city. Three days later, a second bomb, nicknamed "Fat Man," destroyed the city of  Nagasaki. That bomb killed an estimated 60,000 to 80,000 Japanese citizens. About  half of the total deaths were immediate. The remainder of the deaths came months  after, when the survivors of the initial blast became sick from radiation poisoning, and  injuries.
 On August 15, after the two atomic bomb attacks, and a declaration of war on  Japan by the Soviet Union, Japan decided to surrender. The reasoning behind the  decision to use nuclear weapons on Japan is debated to this date. Many say that the  bombs saved Japanese, and American lives. The argument is that because of  Japanese determination, many more lives would have been lost. In any event, the  two attacks are the only nuclear attacks in world history
