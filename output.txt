1. AMERICA: LAND OF OPPORTUNITY
 America is known as the land of opportunity, where one could achieve anything  they put their mind to, no matter who they are. Thousands of people immigrate to  the United States every year from different parts of the world to have access to these  kinds of opportunities. This is what is known as "the American dream". One of the  many reasons America is such a great country is the diversity you see all around.
 America is one big melting pot of citizens from different backgrounds.
 America is also home to many of the world's top colleges and universities. The  California Institute of Technology is a top world-ranked college that focuses highly on  science and engineering. It is located in the city of Pasadena. Harvard University is  another top world-ranked college that you might be familiar with. The buildings at  Harvard date all the way back to the year 1636, making Harvard the oldest university  in the United States. It is located in the state of Massachusetts. University of  California, Los Angeles, is another institute worthy of recognition. Located next to  Hollywood, UCLA has distinguished itself as a prestigious and selective university due  to the number of people who apply for admission throughout the United States. The  universities mentioned are but a few of the many other excellent schools that make  the United States so outstanding.
 America is also known for being at the forefront of freedom and equality. Although  our history may be contradictory to these ideals, we have progressed and now live in  a land of equal opportunity. Whether you wish to become a doctor, a lawyer, or a  librarian, America is the best place to be at to achieve these dreams.

2. THE FOURTH OF JULY
 The Fourth of July is the United States' celebration of its independence from  England. It is the day when the Declaration of Independence was adopted by the new  country's forefathers, and is a national holiday. It has been celebrated every year  since 1776. Americans hold this day as one of the most revered holidays in the  country.
 Independence Day celebrations include firework shows that are held by various  organizations throughout the country. The shows are held at stadiums, recreational  parks, and private homes. Additionally, many businesses have giveaways and special  discounts for all residents on this day. The firework shows are best at stadiums,  where they attract a large number of people. This is a recent change in the way  Americans celebrate the day. In the past, most people bought their own fireworks  from vendors who sell their goods in supermarket parking lots.
 The reason many cities no longer allow the sales, or use of fireworks is because of  the fire hazards they pose. This is why the large, professional celebrations stadiums  and parks have become popular in recent years. Of course, many people still  celebrate at home though. There are some cities where sales and use of fireworks are  still legal, and many Americans take full advantage of this.
 Another Fourth of July tradition is the backyard barbeque. The holiday occurs in  the middle of summer, and Americans love to grill outdoors to avoid the heat inside  the house. Hamburgers and hot dogs are the food of choice, but steaks are also  prepared often. There is nothing better than a great American meal and a cold drink  celebrating the Fourth of July. It is a popular holiday, and it is one that has great  meaning to most Americans.

3. THE U.S. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
 The United States government is composed of three major sections. It is based on  the Constitution of the United States of America that was put into effect in May,  1789. The three parts of the U.S. Government are the executive, legislative, and  judicial branches. Each branch works independently of the other two, and each has its  own responsibilities. This system is in place to ensure that no branch can carry more  power than the other. This is called the separation of powers, which was written into  the Constitution.
 The executive branch is the branch that most Americans are familiar with. It  includes the president of the United States, the vice-president, and the cabinet. The  president is the leader of the country and is the commander-in-chief of the U.S.
 military. The vice-president is second-in-command, and will act as president if the  president dies, resigns, or is removed from office. The cabinet acts as agents of the  U.S. President, and carry out the duties they are entrusted with.
 The legislative branch of government consists of the House of Representatives,  and the Senate. Together they form the congress, which can levy and collect taxes,  mint money, and establish federal courts. It can also declare war, and raise and  support the army, navy, and air force to protect the country. The House of  Representatives has 435 members, and the Senate consists of 100 senators, with two  from each of the states. Any legislation, or new law, must be approved by both the  House of Representatives and the Senate.
 The judicial branch is entrusted to apply the laws created by the legislative branch  of government. It has the power to create lower courts under the Supreme Court of  the United States. It works closely with state courts, although they are separate.

4. CHRISTMAS - A HOLIDAY OF TRADITIONS
 Christmas, observed on December 25, is a Christian holiday that celebrates the  birth of Jesus Christ. Christians of different denominations go to church on Christmas.
 Many Catholics go to midnight mass. In the United States, however, the holiday has a  much more secular tone, and is celebrated throughout the country. Many people,  regardless of their religion, put up and decorate a Christmas tree. The tree can be a  real evergreen or it can be an artificial tree. Lights, strings, tinsel, and even popcorn  can be used to decorate a Christmas tree. On the top of the tree is a star or an angel.
 The decorations are usually red and green.
 The purpose of a Christmas tree is to have a central location to place gifts.
 According to legend, a jolly fat man with a beard, named Santa Claus, leaves  presents under the tree. Children in the U.S. often write lists of things they want  Santa to bring them. Many parents bring their children to shopping malls across the  country to tell a man dressed as Santa what they want. These children are often also  photographed with the mall Santa as a keepsake. On Christmas Eve many children  leave milk and cookies for Santa. Of course it is the parents that buy the gifts from  the wish lists, and even eat the cookies and drink the milk. On Christmas Day  children usually wake up early and run to the tree so they can see what Santa  brought them. Adults can also exchange gifts at this time.
 People don't just decorate a tree at Christmas. Many also elaborately decorate  their homes with lights. Some of the displays are even synchronized to Christmas  songs called carols. Originally these songs were religious, but now they are about the  spirit of the season.

5. NEW YEAR'S DAY - A HOLIDAY OF NEW BEGINNINGS
 New Year's Day officially begins as soon as people yell "Happy New Year" at  midnight. Most people continue partying well after midnight into the wee hours of the  first day of the new year. In fact, many New Year's parties include breakfast or  brunch. Sometimes at the stroke of midnight there will be fireworks and couples  often kiss. One of the most famous New Year's celebrations takes place in New York  City's Time Square, where a huge cut crystal ball drops at midnight in front of  millions of people standing in the cold. Many more millions watch on television. Some  groups, called Polar Bear Clubs, jump into the cold ocean water on New Year's Day as  a literal way to start the new year fresh.
 New Year's Day, January 1, is a national holiday in the United States. This means  that schools, banks, government offices, and post offices are closed. Given how much  people tend to drink alcohol on New Year's Eve, many people wake up on New Year's  Day with a hangover. The national holiday is a good day to recover.
 Many people go out partying with their friends on New Year's Eve; many people  use New Year's Day to visit family members. New Year's Day is also when many  people start on their New Year's resolutions. A resolution is a promise to change a  lifestyle habit. The most common resolution is to lose weight. Many people also join  gyms as part of their resolutions.
 On New Year's Day there are also parades such as the famous Tournament of  Roses Parade in Pasadena, California, where all the floats are made of different  colored roses and they compete for awards. Many people also watch college and  professional football games, including the Rose Bowl, which is also held in Pasadena,  California.

6. MARTIN LUTHER KING JR. DAY - TO REMEMBER A CIVIL
 RIGHTS LEADER  The third Monday in January is an American federal holiday, Martin Luther King Jr.
 Day. It falls near the birthday of the civil rights leader, who was assassinated in 1968.
 King, a minister, became known for non-violently protesting the treatment of African Americans in the United States and laws that discriminated against Blacks.
 Specifically, King protested segregation that separated blacks and whites in public  restrooms, public pools, public schools, on buses, and at restaurants. King led many  marches in the United States, especially in the South where segregation was  especially practiced and enforced, and in Washington D.C. His march on Washington  D.C. was perhaps his most famous one, where he gave the "I have a Dream" speech.
 On Martin Luther King Jr. Day, federal, state, and local offices are closed, including  public schools and post offices. On the holiday many people participate in marches  and vigils remembering Dr. King. Others use the day as a day of service and  volunteer in their community by cleaning up garbage in a local park or serving food  to the homeless. However, the holiday was controversial. Some states didn't want to  honor Dr. King and tried to rename the holiday or combine the day with another  holiday.
 Only two other people have a U.S. national holiday, Christopher Columbus and  George Washington. Martin Luther King Jr. Day became a holiday in 1983 after  pressure from civil rights activists and marches, similar to the ones King used to lead.
 Efforts to create a King holiday began the same year King was killed. The first state  to recognize King Day as a holiday was Illinois. The last state to recognize the holiday  was Arizona.

7. VALENTINE'S DAY - A HOLIDAY OF LOVE AND
 FRIENDSHIP  Valentine's Day, February 14, is a holiday that celebrates love and friendship in  the United States. Most people think of it as a romantic day to show the one you love  how much you care by purchasing cards and gifts. Valentine's Day is also an  extremely commercial holiday. People spend money on flowers, balloons, chocolate,  stuffed animals, and jewelry. People also go out for expensive dinners. Valentine's  Day is even celebrated by school children, who give thank-you cards to their  teachers. Some high schools have Valentine's Day dances. Classmates give each  other little cards. These cards can be purchased at any store with famous cartoon  characters. It is considered much more thoughtful to have kids make handmade  cards to give to friends and teachers.
 Valentine's Day is also a great day to announce your love to someone like a secret  crush. Some people even get married on Valentine's Day. However, you don't have to  be in love to share in the festivities. You can say "Happy Valentine's Day" to friends  and coworkers.
 Valentine's Day is not an official holiday though in the U.S., meaning government  offices and schools are open as usual. The date used to be the celebration of a Saint  named Valentine who allegedly saved a young girl's life. It wasn't until the Middle  Ages that romance somehow got mixed in with the date and lovers would send each  other handwritten love notes. Back then you couldn't just go to the store and buy a  card the way you can now.
 You know Valentine's Day is around the corner when stores begin to decorate with  red and pink hearts and the symbol of Cupid, a winged ancient Roman god said to  strike the hearts of people with his arrow. Now it seems Cupid goes straight after  your wallet because you will also see many more jewelry ads as Valentine's Day  approaches.

8. ST. PATRICK'S DAY - A HOLIDAY TO CELEBRATE THE
 IRISH  Saint Patrick's Day, March 17, is a Christian religious holiday that celebrates the  patron saint of Ireland. According to the legend, St. Patrick drove all the snakes out  of Ireland. St. Patrick's Day has also become, especially in the United States, a day to  celebrate Irish culture. In major cities across the country like in New York and  Boston, there are parades and festivals. People wear green and decorate with  shamrocks, a type of three-leaf clover. Some people wear buttons or tee shirts that  say "Kiss me, I'm Irish". In the U.S. St. Patrick's Day is not a legal holiday, meaning  government offices and schools are open.
 The biggest and oldest parade takes place in New York City. It actually began  about 250 years ago before the U.S. was even its own country. Every year thousands  gather along to watch hundreds of Irish step dancers and bagpipe players march.
 Irish step dancing is done in groups or solo. Dancers perform complicated moves with  their feet and legs while keeping their upper bodies stiff. The parade has also been a  source of controversy because the parade is associated with the Catholic Church in  New York City; gay and lesbian organizations have not been allowed to march. Many  people protest the parade or boycott it.
 St. Patrick's Day has also become associated with the drinking of a lot of alcohol,  specifically beer. One drink that is often seen around the holiday is "Green Beer". This  is really just regular beer with green food coloring. Many people feel like the holiday  celebrates stereotypes about the Irish, like the myth that they all like to drink and  get drunk. Others complain that the holiday has become too focused on drinking,  with public drunkenness as a problem in major cities around the holiday.

9. PASSOVER - A JEWISH HOLIDAY OF REMEMBERING
 Passover is a Jewish holiday that remembers and celebrates their liberation from  ancient Egyptian slavery as described in the Old Testament of the Bible. It is  traditionally celebrated in the spring and lasts about a week.
 According to the story in the Bible, God punished ancient Egypt with 10 plagues.
 The last plague killed Egyptian first-born males. Jewish people were told to mark  their doors with lamb's blood so that God would know to pass over these houses and  not kill any first-born males inside. This is where the name of the holiday, Passover,  comes from. After this last plague the Egyptian king, known as the Pharaoh, agreed  to release the ancient Jews from bondage. The Bible story also says that the Jewish  people left their homes in such a rush after they were freed that they didn't have  time to wait for the bread to rise. This is why at the commemorative Passover meal,  Jewish people eat matzo, bread without yeast, also known as unleavened bread. The  matzo and other foods are eaten at a special meal called a seder.
 There are very specific rituals that happen at the Seder meal. These rituals are all  in a book called the Haggadah. Inside the Haggadah is also the story of the Jewish  exodus from Egypt. During the seder meal parts of the Haggadah are read aloud. The  first part of the meal is a blessing over wine. The second part of the meal is the  washing of hands. The third part of the meal is when someone dips some sort of  vegetable in salt water and then eats the vegetable. The vegetable symbolizes the  humble origins of the Jewish people. The water symbolizes their tears. The fourth  part of the meal is when three pieces of matzo are broken.

10. EASTER - AN IMPORTANT CHRISTIAN HOLIDAY
 Easter is a Christian holiday that celebrates the resurrection of the dead of Jesus  Christ as told in the Bible. Christians are found in church on Easter. Some Christians  participate in an Easter vigil or nighttime mass, sometimes held by candlelight.
 Easter is never on a set date. It is observed on a Sunday between the end of March  and the end of April. The exact date is calculated based on a different calendar. Many  public schools in the U.S. have a week-long vacation around Easter time. Sometimes  this break is called Easter or Spring break.
 In the United States, Easter is also celebrated as a secular holiday. It is associated  with the beginning of spring and symbolized by bunnies, flowers, and dyed eggs.
 Many children in the U.S. believe in a fictional character called the Easter Bunny.
 According to the myth the Easter Bunny leaves baskets full of candy for children.
 Sometimes these baskets are hidden and the children have to find them on Easter  Sunday morning. Candy that is usually inside an Easter basket can include chocolate  in the shape of bunnies or chicks, jellybeans, and marshmallows.
 Another activity associated with Easter is an Easter egg hunt. According to  popular mythology, the Easter Bunny hides painted eggs and children need to find  them. While real eggs used to be used, now it is common to use plastic eggs filled  with candy. There are usually public Easter egg hunts in parks across the country.
 The White House even hosts an Easter egg hunt. Another Easter tradition associated  with Easter is dying real eggs in different, usually pastel, colors like light pink, blue  and yellow.
 In New York City, people take to Fifth Avenue to participate in the Easter Parade.
 The Easter Parade isn't a parade with marching bands and floats. People walk up and  down Fifth Avenue showing off elaborately decorated hats or Easter bonnets.

11. MOTHER'S DAY - A HOLIDAY TO HONOR
 MOTHERHOOD  Mother's Day is a holiday that celebrates and honors mothers in the United  States. It is celebrated on the second Sunday in May. It became an official holiday in  the country at the start of the 20th century as a way to honor mothers whose sons  had died in war.
 The holiday is celebrated in a number of ways. People give mothers gifts like  flowers, cards, and jewelry to thank them for all their hard work. A popular symbol of  the holiday is the carnation. This is because when the holiday first began in the U.S.
 people were encouraged to wear a red carnation if their mother was alive or a white  carnation if their mother was dead. Many people take their mothers out for a special  meal. In fact, Mother's Day is the most popular date in the U.S. for people to go out  and eat and it is estimated that people spend billions on meals and gifts. Mother's  Day is also the most popular day to make long distance calls in the U.S. It is the  second most popular gift-giving day after Christmas.
 Since its establishment, Mother's Day has been criticized for becoming highly  commercialized. In fact, the founder of the U.S. holiday, Anna Jarvis, began  protesting the holiday and was even arrested for disturbing the peace for  demonstrating. Jarvis's own mother started the campaign to establish a mother's  holiday during the American Civil War.
 Mothers are not the only people celebrated on this day. All mother figures  including grandmothers, great-grandmothers, stepmothers, and foster mothers are  honored on the holiday. In schools many students make special gifts, including  handmade cards. While widely recognized, Mother's Day is not a federal holiday.
 Many other countries around the world have their own version of Mother's Day.

12. FATHER'S DAY - A HOLIDAY TO HONOR FATHERHOOD
 Father's Day is a holiday observed in the United States to honor fathers,  fatherhood, and other paternal figures like grandfathers, stepfathers, and uncles. It is  observed on the third Sunday in June.
 In the early 20th century there was a mining accident in West Virginia that killed  almost 400 men. A push for a day to remember the men killed, who were mostly  husbands and fathers, was the start of a push for a national holiday. This was in  1908. It wasn't until 1972, however, that Father's Day was recognized by law as a  national holiday. This is due in part to the fact that people were resistant to what  they saw as another overly invented holiday meant to just make people spend  money. It wasn't seen as a way to remember the dead or to honor living fathers and  father figures. People weren't entirely wrong. Organizations representing men's  clothing manufacturers put in a lot of money for the holiday to become popular.
 Like Mother's Day, it indeed is a holiday that has become highly commercialized.
 There are greeting cards to mark the day, and stores advertise gifts for Dad. These  gifts traditionally include electronics, ties, and tools. In schools, children often make  cards and other gifts. Father's Day is not a federal holiday even though it is widely  celebrated. Some of the ways Father's Day is celebrated is with meals, especially  barbecues since the holiday falls at the beginning of the summer.

13. MEMORIAL DAY - A HOLIDAY TO REMEMBER FALLEN
 SOLDIERS  Memorial Day is a United States holiday to remember the men and women who  have died while serving in the armed forces. The armed forces include all branches of  the U.S. military. Those branches are Army, Navy, Marines, Air Force, and Coast  Guard. Memorial Day is a federal holiday, which means government offices, banks,  post offices, and schools are closed. Memorial Day is always observed on the last  Monday of May. Memorial Day has its roots in the U.S. Civil War when a holiday,  Decoration Day, was established to honor both Union and Confederate soldiers who  died. On Decoration Day people used to "decorate" the graves of deceased soldiers  with flags and flowers. The name Memorial Day became more widely used after World  War II in the late 1940s. However, the holiday wasn't officially called Memorial Day  until 1967.
 Memorial Day is commemorated by ceremonies in cemeteries across the country.
 The most well-known one is held in Arlington National Cemetery near Washington  D.C. Arlington is a military cemetery, meaning only military personnel are buried  there. Volunteers place U.S. flags on military graves at Arlington and other national  cemeteries. There are also parades in honor of fallen service people held in different  towns and cities. Another Memorial Day tradition is flying the U.S. flag at half staff  until noon, meaning it is flown at half its normal height. This is considered a sign of  mourning. The flag is raised to its full height after noon as a sign that the military will  rise up despite the loss. There is also a national Memorial Day concert that takes  place on the lawn of the U.S. Capital.

14. LABOR DAY - A HOLIDAY TO HONOR WORKERS
 Labor Day is observed on the first Monday of September. It is a holiday meant to  honor the contributions, both economic and social, of U.S. workers. It has been an  official federal holiday since 1894, meaning that government offices including post  offices and schools are closed.
 It is also widely thought that Labor Day was created as an alternative holiday to  May Day. May Day, especially in the 1800s, had become a protest day, when workers  marched to demand better rights and working conditions. There were often strikes  that ended in violence. At the time, the U.S. government was afraid that May Day  was being led by communists and was having a bad influence on workers. Some  people feel September was also chosen since there are no other holidays between  Fourth of July and Thanksgiving in November.
 On Labor Day there are usually parades in major cities around the country.
 Politicians and labor leaders make speeches and hold press conferences. Labor Day is  also considered the unofficial end of summer. Many people celebrate Labor Day with  trips to the beaches, picnics, and barbecues. Many towns and cities host fireworks on  this day. Many people also take their last summer vacations around this time. Labor  Day is also the beginning of the professional and college football season in the U.S.
 Labor Day has also become an important retail holiday. Many stores have Labor  Day sales to coincide with the start of the school year for many children in the U.S.
 This means that many store workers, while their holiday is being celebrated, have to  work long hours.

15. COLUMBUS DAY -A HOLIDAY TO REMEMBER AN
 EXPLORER  Columbus Day is observed on the second Monday of October in the United States,  and in some other countries around the world. For a long time it was observed on a  specific date, October 12. It is named after Christopher Columbus, the Italian sailor  who led three Spanish ships to claim new lands in 1492. There is even a child's poem  remembering the date. It reads, "In 1492, Columbus sailed the ocean blue". Some  people say Columbus "discovered" North America, although not everyone agrees with  this interpretation. For example, Columbus never landed on North America proper. He  only got as far as to the islands in the Caribbean Sea.
 Columbus Day has been a federal holiday since 1937; government offices,  schools, and post offices are closed. Many Italians take the day as a day to celebrate  their own ethnic heritage since Columbus was born in Genoa, Italy. Columbus's  explorations, however, were conducted in the name of Spain. Major cities, like New  York City and San Francisco, host large parades. Some cities, like New York City, also  hold a parade celebrating the Hispanic or Latino community.
 Not everyone thinks Christopher Columbus should be honored. Some states like  South Dakota do not observe the holiday at all. Instead they call the day Native  American Day or Indigenous Peoples' Day. In Hawaii the holiday is also known as  Landing Day or Discoverer's Day. This is because European arrival in North America  meant the loss of land and lives for many Native people. Many people hold protests  or vigils on this day to remember the Native Americans that were killed or enslaved  as a result of the European arrival. Another name for the holiday is "Dia de la Raza"  which translates into English as Day of the Race.

16. HALLOWEEN - A HOLIDAY FOR COSTUMES AND
 CANDY  Halloween is on October 31. It is also called All Hallows' Eve or All Saints' Eve.
 This is because, according to some, the holiday has its roots in a Christian holiday  that remembers the dead. Others say the holiday has its roots in the ancient harvest  season traditions of Ireland. In the U.S. though, the focus is less on memories of the  dearly departed or agriculture. It is about kids dressing up in scary costumes and  going door-to-door asking for candy. This is called trick-or-treating.
 When children knock on the door of a house or ring the doorbell, they usually say  "Trick or Treat". The "trick" part is a fake threat signaling that the kids will commit a  prank if they aren't given something delicious. Homeowners then give the children  candy, raisins, or some other food treat. Many homeowners decorate their houses to  prepare for the holiday and let kids know that they are participating and can ring the  bell for candy. Traditional decorations often include jack-o'-lanterns, which are  pumpkins with faces carved into them and candles inside. Jack-o' lanterns were  thought to scare away evil spirits when Halloween was first celebrated among the  ancient Christians. Also turnips, not pumpkins, were originally used. People often  decorate using the colors black and orange.
 Halloween is not just for kids; adults get in on the fun by attending costume  parties. There are often contests for who has the best costume. There are also games  bobbing for apples, where people have to get an apple using only their teeth from a  large bucket of water. Other people celebrate by scaring themselves by going to  haunted houses, homes where people dressed up as ghosts, zombies, and  werewolves and jump out to frighten guests. People also tell scary stories or watch  horror movies.

17. VETERANS DAY - A HOLIDAY HONORING ALL
 SOLDIERS  Veterans Day is an official United States holiday observed on November 11th  every year. While Memorial Day remembers those who have died while serving in any  of the branches of the U.S. Armed Forces -- Army, Navy, Marines, and Coast Guard,  Veterans Day honors all members of the armed forces, especially the living. As a U.S.
 federal holiday, government offices and schools are closed, and most people have the  day off from work. Banks are also closed. If November 11th falls on a Sunday, then  the holiday is observed on the following Monday.
 The holiday was first observed after World War I, which ended On November 11  1918. It was called Armistice Day then and was more about celebrating the absence  of war and honoring those that served in that one war. It didn't become known as  Veterans Day until 1954 after World War II and the Korean War, when there were  many more members of the armed forces.
 Many restaurants offer free meals to veterans on the date. There is always a  special ceremony at Arlington National Military Cemetery in Washington D.C. This  ceremony involves a wreath being placed over the grave of The Unknown Soldier.
 Many major cities also hold parades on this date. The U.S. flag is usually flown at  half-mast as a remembrance to those soldiers who have died and many ceremonies  observe a moment of silence for the same reason. In Canada the holiday is called  Remembrance Day. One symbol of the day is the poppy flower. The red poppy flower  is said to represent or be a symbol of the blood of soldiers. Many people wear or give  out poppy flowers on the day.

18. CHANUKAH - A HOLIDAY OF LIGHTS
 Chanuka, which can also be spelled as Hanukkah, is an 8-day Jewish holiday. It is  known as the Festival of Lights, which celebrates the dedication of an ancient Jewish  temple in Jerusalem thousands of years ago. According to the Hebrew, or Jewish  Bible, a miracle took place then. A one-day supply of oil miraculously lasted eight  days. The dates of Hanukkah always change, but usually occur anywhere in late  November to Late December.
 The main way people observe the holiday is by lighting a candle on a candelabra,  a special candle holder with space for 9 candles on each of the 8 nights. This  candelabra is called a menorah. Now there are also electric menorahs. Some people  also use oil lamps. The 9th candle space is usually higher than the others and is lit on  every night. This 9th candle is there so that people can see the other candles they  are lighting. So, two lights are lit on the first night, three on the second and so on.
 Some families have the head of household light the candles. Other families share the  responsibility. The menorah is supposed to be placed somewhere visible like in a  window facing the street. The candles are supposed to stay lit for at least 30 minutes  after it gets dark. There are also special prayers people say and holy songs sung  when the candles are lit.
 Schools and government offices are open for Hanukkah since the observances  happen at night. Some families exchange gifts on each night of the holiday. Some  foods traditionally eaten on Hanukkah include latkes, fried potato pancakes, and  doughnuts. These and other fried foods are eaten because they are cooked in oil and  remind people of the oil that lasted for 8 nights. Children play with a special four sided spinning top called a dreidel.

19. THANKSGIVING - FAMILIES COMING TOGETHER
 Thanksgiving is a holiday celebrated by many people in the United States and  Canada. In the United States it is celebrated on the fourth Thursday in November and  marks the start of the Christmas season. Some people celebrate Thanksgiving to  remember the first harvest of the pilgrims and puritans, groups of people from  England who immigrated to North America in the 1600s. Some people recreate the  first Thanksgiving and dress up as pilgrims, puritans, and the Native Americans who  are said to have helped the new arrivals find food to survive their first winter.
 Most people, however, see Thanksgiving as one day a year to reflect upon what  they are thankful for. Some families will sit together and take turns saying aloud what  they are thankful for. An important part of Thanksgiving is families coming together.
 Extended family members often travel long distances to share the day with their  loved ones. In the United States Thanksgiving is the busiest travel day of the year.
 People travel in planes, trains, buses, and cars to share a very special meal Thanksgiving dinner.
 What most Thanksgiving celebrations have in common is the food. On  Thanksgiving many families prepare large, elaborate dinners to share with friends  and loved ones. Many of these dinners use ingredients associated with the fall  harvest, like cranberries, potatoes, sweet potatoes, corn, and blueberries. Roast  turkey is the traditional meat served. It is so common that some people call  Thanksgiving Day "Turkey Day". The turkey is usually served with gravy and stuffing.
 Pies are usually served for dessert. The most common pies served are sweet potato,  apple, pecan, and pumpkin.
 Thanksgiving is not just celebrated in the privacy of people's homes. Every year  the President of the United States pardons a turkey, saving it from becoming  someone's meal. In New York City, Macy's, a department store, holds a large parade  with huge balloons of various cartoon characters floating down the street.

20. LOTTERY - A CHANCE AT MILLIONS
 In the United States, 43 states, Washington D.C., Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin  Islands, all have their own lottery. A lottery is used for states to raise money.
 Licensed stores sell numbered tickets, or people can pay to choose their own  numbers. When you let a machine pick your numbers, it is usually called a Quick  Pick. Many people play lucky numbers, numbers associated with birthdates or other  important numbers to them. The money earned from selling lottery tickets goes to  pay for schools, roads, bridges, and other public services. Once a week or more, a  drawing is held where the numbers are randomly picked. If your ticket has those  numbers, you could win a cash prize.
 There are different types of lotteries, such as Powerball, Mega Millions, and Lotto.
 Powerball and Mega Millions are known for their large payouts. There are also instant  lottery tickets that are scratch-off cards. The winnings tend to be less money, but  they are extremely popular.
 In the United States, you can play the lottery, or buy a ticket if you are 18 years  or older. If you win, usually you have the option of being paid the entire amount in  one lump sum or of being paid smaller amounts over a number of years. Lottery  winnings are taxable, meaning the amount you actually get is smaller than the  jackpot number. People can buy lottery tickets or play the lottery at many  convenience stores. Lotteries are also very popular since they advertise. There are  many television commercials, radio commercials, and billboards urging people to  play.
 Lotteries have been controversial since they are essentially a form of legalized  gambling. There is concern that it can lead to people becoming addicted to gambling.
 There are also illegal lottery games, usually run by some forms of organized crime.

21. ONE COUNTRY, MANY TAXES
 Taxes are special fees charged by a government on the people who live in a  country, state or city. These fees help pay for public services like police, road and  bridge repair, and public schools. In the United States people have to pay national,  state, and local taxes. Income tax is a tax applied to how much money a person  earns in a year. There are both federal and state income taxes. These have to be paid  every year by April 15th. There are special forms the Internal Revenue Service (IRS),  the government agency in charge of collecting taxes, asks people to fill out. There are  tax credits that people with low income, college students, and parents can get. These  credits could mean actually getting money back from the government. This money is  called a tax refund. People can get both a federal and state tax refund. Anyone who  works has to be taxed regardless of the immigration status. Not paying income taxes  could mean a fine or even jail time.
 Payroll taxes are taxes that are taken right out of a person's paycheck. There are  federal and state payroll taxes. These include Social Security and Medicare taxes.
 Social Security taxes pay for the retirement and disability benefits received by  millions of Americans each year. Medicare taxes pay for the federal health insurance  program that covers the elderly and the disabled.
 People who own houses pay property taxes. The amount paid depends on how  much the property is worth. This tax is usually paid once a year. Sales tax is a tax  almost everyone pays. Sales tax is a specific extra percentage charged on nearly all  purchases. Everything from soap to furniture has a sales tax attached when bought.
 The amount of the sales tax is different across states and cities.

22. MEDICAL INSURANCE - MAKING IT EASIER TO GET
 HEALTH CARE  Health insurance is one way to pay for health care. Health care includes visits to  the doctor, prescription medication, and emergency services. People can pay for  medicine and doctor visits directly in cash or they can use health insurance. Health  insurance usually means you pay less for these services. There are different types of  health insurance. At some jobs, companies offer health insurance plans as part of a  benefits package. Individuals can also buy health insurance. The elderly, and disabled  can get government-run health insurance through programs like Medicaid and  Medicare. There are many different health insurance companies or plans. Each health  plan has a set of doctors they work with. Once a person picks a plan, they pay a  premium, which is a fixed amount of money every month. Once in a plan, a person  picks a doctor they want to see from that plan. That doctor is the person's primary  care provider.
 Obamacare, or the Affordable Care Act, is a recently passed law that makes it  easier for people to get health insurance. The law requires all Americans have health  insurance by 2014. Those that do not get health insurance by the end of the year will  have to pay a fine in the form of an extra tax when they file their income taxes.
 Through Obamacare, people can still get insurance through their jobs, privately, or  through Medicaid and Medicare. They can also buy health insurance through state  marketplaces, where people can get help choosing a plan based on their income and  health care needs. These marketplaces also create an easy way to compare what  different plans offer. If people cannot afford to buy health insurance, they may qualify  for government programs that offer free health insurance like Medicaid, Medicare, or  for children, a special program called the Children's Health Insurance Program  (CHIP).

23. IMMIGRATION - A BROKEN SYSTEM
 Immigration in the United States is a complicated and controversial issue. Since  the founding of the country people have come from different countries in search of a  better life and opportunities. Immigration laws, however, are always changing and  are complicated. This leads to many people coming into the U.S. without proper legal  status. While some people call immigrants who come and stay in the U.S. without the  proper papers "illegals", many consider this term offensive. The more acceptable  term is "undocumented" since they do not have the correct legal documents.
 It is estimated that there are more than 11 million undocumented people in the  Unites States. While some people will say there is no reason for immigrants to be  undocumented in the U.S., there are limits on the number of Green Cards, or legal  permanent resident cards, people from certain countries can get. There are also long  waiting lists, up to 14 years in some cases, for people coming from certain countries,  to apply for legal status in the U.S. Additionally there are a limited amount of visas,  or permits, for people coming into the U.S. with manual labor skills. Millions of  undocumented people have been deported, or sent back to their country of origin  under President Obama.
 In 2013, the U.S. Senate passed an immigration reform bill. The law adds extra  border security along the U.S.-Mexico border, and also makes it easier for immigrants  to become citizens. The bill, which also has to be approved by the House of  Representatives, has not yet been presented or voted on by Congress. Because of  this, many are asking President Obama to take action to protect some of the  undocumented, many of whom have been in the U.S. for many years and have  children that are U.S. citizens.

24. COMMUNITY COLLEGES (1)
 The American community college system is a place for second chances.
 Community colleges are two-year schools that thrived in California after the end of  World War II. Many American military personnel were returning to civilian life after  their service to the country. Some of these young people decided not to go to college  after high school so that they could serve their country during that time of need.
 When they returned, many of them turned to the community college system in  California to continue their education.
 The United States government introduced the G.I. Bill at that time giving  returning servicemen and women educational benefits to help them get back to  school. Soon community colleges and new school districts began appearing  throughout the country. Community colleges helped ease returning military personnel  back into college life. It was a low cost, less stressful alternative to going back to a  four-year university.
 Today, community colleges attract students from all parts of the world. In  California, a large population of students comes from Asia and Latin America. These  schools provide a second chance to international students who may have experienced  difficulties attending college in their native countries. American students who may  have not done well academically in high school, and did not enter a university, can  turn to community college for a second chance, too.
 Community colleges provide a much-needed resource for all these students.
 Former military personnel, international students, and high school students alike, are  all welcome. One of the best things about community colleges is that they accept  anyone at anytime. This means people who have not found what they want to do in  life can try more than one area of study. If they don't like one course of study, they  can always try something else. That is the beauty of community colleges.

25. COMMUNITY COLLEGE (2)
 These days many people attend community colleges with plans to transfer to a  four-year college or university to get a bachelor's degree. It's kind of like a stepping stone. There are many reasons why people do this. One reason is that some  community colleges have transfer agreements with private and state colleges and  universities that guarantee admission. Even if a community college doesn't have that  agreement of a guaranteed spot in a four-year college, it has articulation agreements  with four-year schools. These agreements tell you exactly what classes a student in a  community college needs to take in order to be able to transfer. These agreements  make sure that students don't waste time taking classes that won't transfer. Most of  these classes one needs to take before transferring are general education classes,  like math and English.
 Another reason why many students start their undergraduate degree at a  community college is a financial one. A four-year college or university is much more  expensive than a two-year college. This is especially true for immigrant students,  who don't qualify for financial aid, loans or scholarships. Also community colleges  tend to offer more evening classes so they can accommodate people who have to  work while attending school. They are also a good option for older students with  families, who need a more flexible schedule while taking care of children. Community  colleges also tend to be commuter schools, meaning people don't have to live on  campus in dorms. Attending a community college means you can still live at home  with your parents, which can save the family a huge amount of money.
 If a student didn't do well in high school, a community college would provide him  or her with another opportunity to enter a four-year university. Community colleges  offer many classes to help students develop their math and writing skills. When you  attend a four-year college, you are expected to have those skills already. Community  college will prepare students to successfully graduate from a four-year school.

26. ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS IN THE U.S.
 Most children in the U.S. begin school at age 5, when they go to kindergarten.
 This is the beginning of elementary or primary school. Most children stay in  elementary schools till they are about 11 years old. Elementary schools are divided  by grades. The youngest children begin in kindergarten at 5, and then go to first  grade, second grade and so on. Most elementary schools go up to fifth or sixth grade.
 The focus of an elementary school is basic academic and socialization skills.
 Mostly children learn how to read, write, count, add, subtract, multiply, and divide.
 Students also learn the rules of English grammar, spelling, and vocabulary. Children  also learn basic social studies or history, science, art, and music skills, and participate  in gym or physical education. In elementary schools children also learn how to follow  directions, share, and work in groups. Students usually stay in one classroom all day  with one teacher who stays with them throughout the year. Students may leave the  classroom to visit the school library, the school gym, and attend special science, art,  and music classes. Students also usually leave the classroom for lunch and recess.
 For lunch students sit at tables, separated by grade, in a large cafeteria. Recess is  usually a half hour when children go out into a yard to play. The typical school day  starts at about 8:00 in the morning and ends at about 3:00 p.m. Students go to  school from Monday to Friday and have the weekends off.
 Elementary school teachers are licensed by the state where they work. They have  to graduate from college, or even graduate school taking special classes in Early  Childhood and Elementary Education. Before teachers can be in a classroom with  students, they have to pass a background check and take an exam.

27. MIDDLE SCHOOLS IN THE U.S.
 Once a child finishes 5th or 6th grade in elementary school, they graduate and go  on to middle school or junior high school. This school is a separate building or set of  buildings. Most students in middle school are between the ages of 10 and 14. The  grade system continues in middle school. Middle school usually starts with 6th or 7th  grade and ends with 8th grade. While they are less common, some elementary  schools go from kindergarten to 8th grade.
 Most students are assigned a middle school based on where they live. However,  there are charter, private, and specialized public middle schools that have an  application process. The purpose of middle school is to provide a transition period  between elementary school and high school. Middle school prepares students for high  school life. In middle school students don't stay in one classroom all day with one  teacher. Students change classrooms for different subjects and have different  teachers for each subject. In middle school some students may even be able to  choose some of their own classes, called electives. There is a set of core classes that  all students have to take. These include English, math, science, and social studies or  history classes. Gym or physical education classes are also required.
 A common feature of middle school is a homeroom, which is a classroom students  visit at a scheduled time once a day or once a week. A homeroom teacher takes  attendance and makes announcements of things students need to know. The  homeroom also helps students feel like there is one common place and one common  teacher they see regularly. This is to help with the transition from elementary school  to secondary school. Once a student finishes middle school, they have a graduation  ceremony and go to a high school assigned to them or a high school they picked.

28. HIGH SCHOOL IN THE U.S.
 After middle or junior high school, U.S. students go to high school. Going to  school is free in the United States, including high schools. Students do not need to  pay tuitions, and even textbooks and lunches are free. Of course, we are talking  about public schools. If parents choose to send their kids to private schools, they  need to pay very expensive tuitions. High school is the last four years of school that  students in the U.S. are required to attend by law.
 High school students are divided by grades. It begins at 9th grade and finishes  with 12th grade. Some high schools, even public high schools, have admission exams  or an application process. Public schools admit students based on where they live. In  order to successfully complete high school, students have to complete a series of core  classes including math, English, science, history, a foreign language, and gym or  physical education. Students usually can also choose to take electives, or specialized  courses in a subject that interests them. Some high schools in the U.S. have exit  exams that students are required to pass in addition to completing their courses in  order to graduate and earn a high school diploma. A law called the No Child Left  Behind Act requires high schools that get federal money to make students take a  standardized exam every year. A high school diploma is required for students who  want to continue on to college and is considered a minimum requirement for any  jobs.
 High schools classes are designed to prepare students for college. Some high  schools offer specialized skills so that students can find work after graduation without  going to college. Those are called vocational high schools. In high school, some  students have the opportunity to take Advanced Placement (AP) classes. These are  college level classes. If the students pass an exam after taking AP classes, they can  get college credit. In high school, students move from class to class throughout the  school day.

29. HOMESCHOOLING
 Not every parent looks forward to the day when their child goes off to school. In  fact some parents are not sending their students to school at all. Instead they are  choosing to teach their children at home. This is called homeschooling. Parents,  caregivers, or private tutors educate children individually at home instead of sending  them off to be formally educated in public or private schools. In the U.S. only about  three percent of children are homeschooled.
 There are many reasons why some parents choose to homeschool. One reason is  that some parents do not feel their children are safe in school because of bullying and  a growing trend of police in school. Other parents want their child's education to be  based on their religion or moral beliefs. Yet other parents feel like the education in  school is not good enough. Homeschooling is also seen as a choice for families that  live in rural areas, and families that travel, like actors.
 There are many different ways to homeschool, and homeschooling allows parents  to customize lessons based on their children's needs. Families can purchase  textbooks to use or create their own materials. Some parents follow a philosophy  called unschooling, which allows a child to determine when, and how they want to  learn based on their natural curiosity. Some worry that homeschooling means  students won't have opportunities to socialize. To answer this concern, some families  have created cooperatives, where a group of homeschooled students will learn and  play together and participate in activities that would normally happen in school like  field trips and prom.
 Being homeschooled doesn't mean a student cannot go to college. Most colleges  accept homeschooled students. It is important, however, for parents and students to  create a portfolio or proof of what has been learned.

30. PARENT-TEACHER CONFERENCES
 When parents send their children to school, often they don't know what happens  day to day. Parents rely on what their children tell them about how they are doing  and what they are learning. Generally schools will host parent-teacher conferences at  least twice a year. Parent-teacher conferences are short meetings between parents  and their children's teachers. Usually parent-teacher conferences are held when  teachers give out a student's grades for the term. The parent-teacher conferences  give teachers an opportunity to let parents know how their child is doing. A teacher  will let a parent know the student's strengths and bring to the parent's attention any  problems with grades or behavior. The meetings also offer parents the opportunity to  ask questions and see what their child is learning.
 When it is almost time for parent-teacher conferences, the school will send  parents a note and usually give them an appointment time. There are appointments  during the day and in the evening. Evening appointments are used for parents who  work during the day. Parent-teacher conferences do not last very long. Normally they  do not last longer than 10 minutes. This is why it is important for parents to make  sure they arrive at their appointments on time and come prepared with questions. If  a parent needs more than 10 minutes, he or she should try to schedule another  meeting with the teacher. Keeping a teacher for more than 10 minutes when there  are parents waiting is disrespectful.
 Most children do not go along with their parents to the meetings. This allows both  the parent and teacher to talk honestly about the child's progress without making the  child feel bad. Usually a teacher will offer advice to the parent on how to support  their child's education.

31. PRIVATE SCHOOLS - AN EXPENSIVE EDUCATIONAL
 ALTERNATIVE  Public schools are available for kids from kindergarten through 12th grade free of  charge. However, many families choose to pay for their children's primary and  secondary education by sending them to private schools. There are many different  types of private schools and many different reasons why parents send their kids  there. Some private schools are military type and yet others are boarding schools  where students live on campus. Some private schools are affiliated with a certain  religion. These schools teach a specific faith's beliefs and traditions as well as the  regular academic subjects. There are schools run by Catholics, Protestants, Jewish  people, Muslims, and Orthodox Christians. There are also private schools that  specialize in teaching disabled students.
 Some parents choose private schools because they feel that they offer a better  education than public schools; others choose private schools because they offer a  different type of curriculum. Waldorf Schools, for example, only let children play and  use items made of natural materials.
 Private schools are also called independent schools or non-state schools because  they are not run by local, state, or national governments. They can pick what  students to go to their schools. They do this through admission examinations and  interviews. There is often an admissions application. Some private schools accept  anyone who can pay tuition to send their children there. Some schools charge up to  $45,000 a year. Private schools charge tuition because they do not get any money  collected from local, state, and national taxes. Some private schools offer a limited  number of scholarships to help pay for school. Many of these scholarships are need based, meaning for students who can't afford the tuition. Other scholarships are  offered for students with very good grades or for students that have a talent in a  sport or art.

32. THE CALIFORNIA COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY SYSTEM
 California is the largest state in the United States of America. It is home to more  than 10 percent of the country's total population. It also has the largest education  system in the country. The college and university system is divided into four parts.
 Those parts are the University of California system, the California State University  system, the community college system, and private institutions.
 The UC system has more than 230,000 students at its 10 Campuses. It is  considered the more prestigious system in the state. It includes top universities like  UC Berkeley, and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Both schools rank  in the top 25 universities in the country, with Berkeley in the top 10. A degree from  the UC system is highly sought, and the academic standards are higher than the  other systems. They are also more expensive.
 The California State Universities counts 23 universities in its system. It is a  diversified system that includes two polytechnic universities, and a maritime  university. These schools offer vocational and maritime education, but also offer  traditional, academic programs. The systems enrollment is approximately 450,000  students, with about 45,000 faculty members.
 The California Community Colleges system is the largest systems of higher  education in the state, and the world. It boasts 112 campuses, and serves  approximately 2.4 million students. It offers transfer degrees, vocational training, and  associates degree programs.

33. DRIVING IN THE UNITED STATES
 Driving in the U.S. can be confusing not just because of all the rules and laws that  drivers must follow, but also because of driving customs. Many people in the U.S. are  really dependent on their cars to get to work and school. In fact most American  workers spend an hour driving to work each day. In order to drive in the U.S., you  have to go to your local Department of Motor Vehicles first, and take a written test to  get your learner's permit. If you pass this test, you can practice driving so you can  pass a road test and get your license. The Department of Motor Vehicles or DMV has  free booklets you can go and get to study for your learner's permit. You can also  access the information online and even take a practice written exam. To prepare for  the road test, you can have a friend teach you to drive or pay to take classes at a  driving school. You cannot, however, practice driving by yourself. If you are caught  driving with only a learner's permit, you can get into trouble with the law.
 Once you get your driver's license in one state, you can use it to drive in all of the  United States. Wherever you drive, you will see signs posted along the road  indicating the speed limit. These numbers are not a suggestion. Generally you can  drive faster on a highway than on local streets. Local police use special equipment to  detect your speed. If they detect you are speeding or driving over the speed limit,  police can stop you and give you a ticket. You will have to pay a fine, and some of the  fines are more than $100. The lines painted on the road are not just to keep cars in  their lanes. They send a message. For example, a double solid yellow line means that  it is against the law to pass another car here.

34. PASADENA ROSE PARADE
 Each New Year's Day, the city of Pasadena in California hosts a celebration to  welcome the year with a series of events that includes the Rose Parade. The parade  takes place in the center of the city on Colorado Blvd, and features numerous floats,  marching bands, equestrian teams, celebrities, and honorees. It is the most popular  parade in the country. It has spawned several other New Year's Day parades  throughout the country. In Miami, it's the Orange Bowl Parade; in New Orleans, it is  the Sugar Bowl Parade; in Arizona, it's called the Fiesta Bowl Parade. However, the  Rose Parade is the oldest and best parade. Many people like to camp out in tents or  in sleeping bags the night before to get the best locations to view the Rose Parade.
 To brave the cold weather, some people bring portable heaters to keep them  warm. It can get into the low 40s at night in Pasadena during the winter, so many  people dress warm for the occasion. Food is another big feature at the pre-parade  celebration on New Year's Eve. People bring their portable grills to cook their favorite  outdoor meals right on the sidewalk. The rich aroma of the grilling food fills the night  air, and most people are willing to share their food with other overnight campers. It is  fun to sample different dishes from other grillers.
 As night turns into morning, there is still electricity in the air. People are excited  about the start of the parade, which begins at 8 a.m. sharp. The floats are beautifully  decorated in flowers, while the dancers and other performers dress in colorful  costumes, some of which are made just for the parade. The marching bands come  from nearby cities, high schools, and colleges. It is considered a great honor to  participate in the Rose Parade.

35. SELFIES
 The self-portrait is nothing new. Painters and photographers have always used  themselves as subjects. Today, however, almost everyone walks around with a  camera in his or her pocket. This is because most cell phones have cameras on them.
 The fact that most people have cell phone cameras with them all the time has led to  the rise of the selfie. A selfie is a self-portrait usually taken with a cell phone.
 Since the pictures are usually taken on a cell phone, many people tend to share  these photographs with friends and even strangers on different social networking  websites. Some of the popular social networking platforms people use to share selfies  include Instagram, Snapchat, and Facebook.
 People usually take selfies when they are engaged in normal day-to-day activities.
 They take selfies of their commutes to work or school. People take selfies of  themselves eating. Other people take selfies to show what they are wearing or whom  they are hanging out with.
 The most common way to take a selfie is by holding a cell phone at arm's length.
 Some people take selfies by taking a picture of their reflection in a mirror. In these  pictures, you can usually see the phone the person is taking a picture with. Selfies  taken using a mirror often are taken in a bathroom, which some people think is  offensive. The bathroom is a very private place, not a place to take pictures.
 Some people think that selfies are a sign that people are becoming vain or  superficial. It is not often that people take pictures of themselves that make them  look bad. When people take pictures of themselves, they usually are trying to present  themselves in the best light. However, some people use selfies to show what they  really look like. Some people are trying to challenge stereotypes of what makes  someone attractive.

36. APARTMENT PETS
 In U.S. cities like New York City and Los Angeles, many people live in small  apartments. Despite not having homes with big yards, some apartment dwellers still  seek the companionship that domesticated animals like dogs and cats offer. Some  people feel that having a pet, even in a small space, is good for teaching children  responsibility.
 However, many landlords forbid tenants from having pets, specifically cats and  dogs, because of the damage the animals can do to carpets. Some landlords even  forbid birds because of the noise they make. Many landlords charge an extra fee,  known as a pet deposit, to tenants who want to keep pets. This is to pay for repairs  or cleaning caused by the pet.
 Many times apartment dwellers will choose animals, like fish, hermit crabs, guinea  pigs or hamsters, that make little noise, little mess, and won't chew up the furniture.
 Other people keep lizards as pets, since they don't require much space and can be  kept in small cages or tanks. Another benefit of these smaller pets is that they don't  need to be walked. However, some people who live in apartments have pets that are  not so ordinary. Some of these less than ordinary pets include mammals like  hedgehogs, amphibians like frogs, and spiders like tarantulas. Not all exotic pets are  legal though.
 In order to maintain public safety, some cities and states have laws banning  specific animals as pets. New York City, for example, bans people from keeping  ferrets, snapping turtles, pythons, and scorpions as pets. It seems unlikely that a  family would have a polar bear named Fluffy or a whale named Bubbles as a pet, New  York City has specific laws banning these wild animals from residences. These laws  exist for a good reason. In 2003, a man in a Manhattan apartment was discovered to  have a 350-pound Bengal tiger as a pet.

37. NON-TRADITIONAL WAKES
 A wake is when people go to a deceased person's home or a funeral parlor to pay  their last respects. A funeral parlor is a place where the preparation of the corpse for  burial takes place. Part of the preparation can be dressing the deceased, doing their  makeup, and placing them in a coffin for people to see. Some people do have a  closed casket wake, where you can't see the dead person; some people are not even  choosing coffins for their dearly departed loved ones.
 In the United States, more and more families are choosing not to have traditional  wakes. There is a recent trend of people having non-traditional wakes with the  deceased person posed doing something they loved doing when they were alive. For  example, a family in New Orleans had their dead loved one posed at a table with a  cigarette between her fingers and a can of beer. One funeral home in Puerto Rico has  become famous for its non-traditional wakes. It all started in 2008, when a family  asked for their dead loved one to be propped up against the wall of their home for  the wake. When a paramedic died, his family had his dead body in the driver's seat of  an ambulance. Another family had a man propped up in a fake boxing ring for his  wake. One dead man was posed on top of his motorcycle. Recently, a grandmother  was posed sitting in her rocking chair.
 These non-traditional wakes have their critics though. Some people think they are  disrespectful. They think of death as a solemn and sad occasion, not a time to pose  the dead as if they were toys. Fans feel it helps them remember the dead as they  were when they were alive.

38. HOMELESSNESS IN LOS ANGELES
 It is very common to see homeless people on the streets of Los Angeles. This is a  problem that has persisted in the city since the beginning of the 20th century. Back in  that time, California was known for offering many job opportunities in farming, and  many young men were hopping on trains from all over the country to arrive in Los  Angeles. Unfortunately, many of those men often ended up finding themselves  without a job, a place to stay, or even food to eat. To help these people, many  churches began to establish shelters in the area of Los Angeles that would eventually  become Downtown. Even as the farm landscape changed to a big city environment,  these shelters remained a refuge for many individuals that found themselves  homeless  Nowadays, the homeless population of Los Angeles is made up of much more than  just young men looking for work. Many economic and social changes have resulted in  both men and women of all ages turning to the streets of Los Angeles. Some of them  are there as a result of substance abuse that has left them moneyless and jobless.
 Others are veterans from various wars that cannot find the resources to get back to  their normal lives. Additionally, many of these people suffer from mental disabilities  that limit them from finding a job or being accepted in the rest of society.
 Since there are a lot of different causes that lead to homelessness, it is easy to  see why finding solutions to helping all of the homeless people is so difficult. Although  there are many programs that focus on providing the homeless food daily, it is much  harder to find programs that try to assist the homeless in finding jobs, and stable  housing. In order to finally find a solution that will effectively help decrease the  number of homeless people in the city, a lot more individualized attention must be  placed on individuals based on their physical and mental health, and circumstance.

39. PARAMEDICS
 Some of the everyday heroes in the United States are the country's paramedics.
 These young men and women are usually the first people who respond to medical  emergencies suffered by citizens. Paramedics must complete a very extensive  physical training program that is designed to weed out those who cannot make the  cut. A paramedic must be in fit condition, and be mentally strong to perform his or  her duties in the face of danger. Many of these heroes must endure life-threatening  situations when responding to emergencies. Paramedics are usually attached to a  county, or city fire department, but there are also some private paramedic  organizations.
 In Southern California, there are two primary schools for paramedic training. They  are UCLA's Daniel Freeman Paramedic program and the Paramedic Training Institute.
 Both of these schools provide candidates for the Los Angeles County and City Fire  Departments. To become a paramedic for a county or city organization, candidates  must also pass a psychological screening and a physical training program.
 Some of the equipment paramedics carry is very specialized. They carry basic and  advanced life support gear such as forcible entry tools so they can reach people in  peril, saws to cut through obstacles, and other emergency equipment. Paramedics  provide a valuable service to the communities they serve. They must be certified in  Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) techniques, and be trained to handle all  situations.
 Some paramedics are trained to respond to what is called Mass Casualty Incidents  (MCI). These emergencies occur whenever there is a tragic event such as the  September 11, 2001 attacks on the country, and other emergencies like earthquakes,  mudslides, or floods. Paramedics can also be sent to emergency situations by citizens  who call the 911 emergency phone number.

40. SEPTEMBER 11TH
 One of the darkest days in American history was September 11, 2001. This is "a  day that will live in infamy" for most Americans. It was the most tragic day in the  history of the country since December 7, 1941 when the Japanese attacked Pearl  Harbor. September 11th was the day Muslim extremists hijacked four commercial  airliners in an attempt to destroy the American spirit by slamming those jets into four  buildings. Three of the four jets reached their targets, while one was stopped by a  group of everyday heroes who gave their lives for their country.
 In the early morning hours on September 11, 2001, American Airlines Flight 11  slammed into the north tower of the World Trade Center in New York City. A few  minutes later, Flight 175, also an American Airlines flight, struck the south tower.
 Both suicide attacks brought the towers down, but not immediately. It took time for  the extreme heat from the burning jet fuel to weaken the towers to their eventual  collapse. At about the same time, American Airlines, Flight 77 crashed into the  Pentagon, which is a government building in the country's capitol, Washington D.C.
 The fourth flight, United Airlines Flight 93, was also headed for the capitol city.
 Most people think its target was either the capitol building, or the White House, the  president's home. A group of brave passengers, upon hearing the news of what was  happening in the country, decided to take down the giant airplane even though they  knew they would not survive. They stormed the cockpit and took the controls from  the hijackers. The plane flew out of control, crashing into a field in the state of  Pennsylvania, where all passengers were killed.
 In all, about 3,000 Americans lost their lives on that day, but the American spirit  was not suppressed. Those responsible for the attacks were quickly dealt with, and  the country soon began its journey to recovery. September 11, 2001, a day America  will never forget.

41. THE CALIFORNIA REDWOODS AND GIANT SEQUOIAS
 Some of the most majestic landscape views in California are the great California  Redwood and Sequoia trees. These trees can be seen up close at Sequoia National  Park in the southern Sierra Nevada mountain range, of Visalia. This central California  region boasts more than 400,000 acres of natural beauty that is uniquely Californian.
 The park is known as the Land of the Giants because of its beautiful trees. The  landscape features great mountains, foothills, deep canyons, a large cavern system,  and, of course, the world's largest trees.
 The park sits side by side with King's Canyon National Park in the stunning San  Joaquin Valley. Sequoia National Park was officially established as a national park in  the 1890s. It features 14 campsites that include picnic tables, fire rings for outdoor  cooking, and food storage boxes. It is a great place for a family vacation with many  of its campsites open year round. But the most popular attractions are its forests.
 The ancient trees are some of the oldest living organisms on earth, and draw millions  of visitors worldwide. Redwood trees can reach heights of more than 375 feet. They  are closely related to the Giant Sequoia trees, and are often mistaken for each other.
 They both are uniquely Californian, as they do not grow naturally in any other region  in the world.
 Redwood trees live up to 2,000 years, and have branches that grow up to five feet  in diameter. Its bark can grow up to 12 inches thick. The Giant Sequoia trees can live  up to an astonishing 3,000 years, and have branches up to eight feet in diameter. Its  bark can grow to an amazing thickness of three feet. Both trees have dark brown  bark, and look very similar, but the Redwood thrives in coastal climate, while the  Sequoia exists in more mountainous areas. In either case, they are a must-see  California attraction.

42. THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL
 There are many law enforcement agencies in the United States, and especially in  California. Some of the largest agencies in Southern California are the Los Angeles  Police Department, and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. Both of these  police forces are some of the largest in the country. They handle a full-range of police  duties ranging from traffic citations to murder, rape, and robbery cases. There are  also a number of smaller police agencies operating side by side with the LAPD and  L.A. County Sheriff's Department. Cities, such as Monterey Park, have their own  police force, while smaller cities depend on the Sheriff's Department for their law  enforcement needs. Because of the unique nature of the state, California created the  California Highway Patrol.
 The CHP, as it is usually called, is a police agency that is entrusted with patrolling  the vast number of freeway miles that exist in California. The state was built during a  time of great mobility after the advent of the personal vehicle. Because of this, the  state has more freeway miles than any other states in the United States with the  exception of Texas. However, California has the most licensed drivers, and by far, the  most registered vehicles. This made it necessary to create a police force dedicated to  its highways.
 CHP officers are endowed with the same powers other police officers have.
 However, they do not have a crime investigation team for any offense other than  traffic-related crimes. Whenever the CHP first responds to a crime that is not traffic related, its officers perform the same duties a regular officer does. It then turns  investigations over to the LAPD, or Sheriff's office depending on the location of the  crime. The CHP has a long, and storied history. Many young Californians, both male  and female, are attracted to the CHP, and enroll into its academy in Sacramento, the  state's capital.

43. THE GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE
 One of the most beautiful, and recognizable California landmarks is the Golden  Gate Bridge in the city of San Francisco. The bridge spans the San Francisco Bay, and  is part of a network of five main bridges that cross the bay in the San Francisco and  Oakland area. The region with its bay has one of the most breathtaking views in the  world, and part of which is the historic Golden Gate Bridge.
 It is perhaps the most iconic and recognizable landmark in the entire United  States. Construction on the bridge began in 1933, while the country was deeply  mired in the Great Depression. Many people think the bridge was, in large part,  responsible for the country's economic recovery because of the number of workers  employed. The material used to build the bridge also contributed to the  manufacturing, distribution, and transportation.
 The bridge connects San Francisco to the San Francisco peninsula in Marin County  through both California State Route 1, and U.S. Route 101. Before the bridge was  built, the only way to get from one location to the other was to go around the bay, or  to take a ferry across. Construction of the bridge was controversial at the time. Many  thought the project was simply too complex, expensive, and dangerous to build. The  construction plan approved concentrated on safety for the workers who would be  involved in the construction, and it worked well until February 17, 1937. Remarkably,  only one worker had died up to that date, but on that date, a scaffolding collapsed  killing 10 men in the tragic accident.
 The bridge was completed later that year, and has been in use ever since. It is  one of California's great landmarks with people from all over the world drawn to see  it.

44.THE SAN FRANCISCO CABLE CARS  One of the most historic, and significant landmarks in the United States is the San  Francisco cable car system. It is the world's only, manually operated cable car  system. It is run by the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency. The system  dates back to 1878, when the California Street line first opened. In all, there are  three lines currently operating in the city, and boasts a fleet of 12 cable cars. There  used to be 23 lines in use throughout the city connecting the diverse communities  that make up San Francisco. The open-air cars are a major tourist attraction, and are  still used by San Francisco commuters on a daily basis.
 The simple reason cable cars were first used in the city was because of its  landscape. San Francisco is very hilly, which makes it impossible for municipal buses  to scale. The solution for this problem was the cable car. These cars are literally  pulled by cable, up and down the steep hills of the city, making it easier for people to  get from one end of the city to the other.
 There are two types of cars in use today. Single-ended cars and double-ended  cars. The single-ended cars have open-sided sections with seats that face outward to  the street. The rear section of these cars is enclosed with seats facing the interior of  the car. These cars seat 29 passengers. They travel in both directions by using a  swivel-based turntable that turns the car at the end of the line. The double-ended  cars are a bit larger, and can hold up to 68 passengers. It has 34 seats, and grips for  an additional 34 standing passengers. The best feature of these cars is the pure fun  they are to ride. People who ride the San Francisco cable cars are stepping into part  of California's history.

45. CAR CHASE TELEVISION
 Car chases in the Los Angeles area are a fairly regular occurrence. In 2013 there  were over 700 car chases. Car chases also have become a source of entertainment.
 Many car chases are captured on video and broadcast live as they are happening. No  one has to wait until the six o'clock news comes on anymore to find out about what  happened. People can tune in to their local broadcast television station and see it  happening in real time. These car chases are often captured with the help of a news  channel's helicopter. The helicopter follows and films the chase through the streets,  reporting what streets the cars are passing through.
 People like watching car chases for many reasons. They are intense, and filled  with drama. A viewer never knows what will happen next. Will the driver give up  easily? Does the driver have a weapon? Will the driver get into an accident? Will  someone crossing the street get hit? Tune in to find out! Many channels see their  ratings soar when they air car chases. They are just giving the people what they  want.
 Police are not always happy with the media covering car chases live on the air.
 Police worry that people trying to escape enjoy the attention. Police feel that  broadcasting car chases encourages people to escape. Police also worry that the  attention brings innocent bystanders to the street. Someone could get hurt. The  media insists they have the right to show car chases. They feel they are informing  the public.
 Car chases happen for many reasons. Sometimes police will chase someone who  stole a car. Other times the police may try to do a routine traffic stop. However, the  driver with the broken taillight may have a warrant for arrest, so off he drives.

46. LOS ANGELES CORONER'S OFFICE
 In Los Angeles, places associated with death are often popular. One such popular  place is the Department of Medical Examiner-Coroner. When someone dies and the  cause of death is undetermined or suspicious, the body is brought here for  examination. It is the coroner's job to determine the time, cause, and manner of  death. Sometimes the coroner will have to perform an autopsy, which is like an  operation on a dead body to try to figure out how the person died. One of the  reasons the L.A. Coroner's Office is so popular is because of the number of famous  people who have been examined there. Some of those people include Marilyn  Monroe, Robert F. Kennedy, Michael Jackson, and Whitney Houston.
 The Los Angeles Coroner's Office is so popular that there is even a gift shop where  visitors can buy items like shirts, caps, and mugs with the Coroner's logo on them.
 One tee-shirt people can buy even says, "Our bodies of work speak for themselves".
 They even sell beach towels with body outlines. The store is open five days a week.
 They also have a website and a paper catalog for those who are not close enough to  visit. The Coroner's Office claims the purpose of the store is to tell people how fragile  life is and to create awareness and responsibility toward one's actions. Some people  feel that having a store in the same place where dead people are is disrespectful.
 There have been a number of television shows about the L.A. Coroner's Office.
 Some of these are reality TV shows featuring what workers really do there. An  example is called "Death Detectives". Other shows are fictional like "Quincy M.E." The  M.E. stands for medical examiner, the person who performs the autopsies.

47. MUSEUM MILE IN NEW YORK CITY
 On one of New York City's most famous avenues, Fifth Avenue, is Museum Mile.
 Museum Mile is a 23-block stretch that holds some of the most famous museums in  the world. Museum Mile begins at 85th Street and Fifth Avenue with the massive  Metropolitan Museum of Art. Inside is thousands of years worth of art and artifacts. A  visitor can visit an entire Egyptian tomb, sit in a Japanese style garden, view  Renaissance paintings, and ancient Greek and Roman sculptures. There is even a  gallery featuring musical instruments. In the summer, there is a rooftop garden  where there are spectacular views of the city, especially of Central Park.
 The Guggenheim, on 88th Street and Fifth Avenue, looks a little bit like a snail's  shell from the outside. When it opened in the 1950's, the swirling architecture,  designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, was thought to be ugly by many. This museum  focuses on modern art, but sometimes features special exhibits like one they had a  few years ago of ancient Mexican ruins. The National Academy Museum and School of  Fine Arts on 91st Street and Fifth Avenue is the city's oldest art school, dating back  to 1825. The Jewish Museum on 93rd Street and Fifth Avenue, tells 4,000 years  worth of Jewish History. Up ten blocks on 103rd Street and Fifth Avenue is the  Museum of the City of New York, showcasing the history of the Big Apple from its  colonial start.
 One block up on 104th Street and Fifth Avenue is El Museo del Barrio. This  museum started as a space to reflect the city's large Puerto Rican migrant  community. Now it features exhibits focusing on art from all over Latin America.
 Across the avenue is the Central Park Conservatory Garden, with a fountain that has  a sculpture of three dancing life-size women.

48. A BUILDING FOR THE EMPIRE STATE
 The Empire State Building may be the most famous building in New York City. It is  called the Empire State Building because New York State is called the Empire State. It  is 1,454 feet tall. Many people think it is the tallest building in the world. This was  true when it was built in 1931. In 1970, when the World Trade Center was built, that  became the tallest building. Now, the Empire State Building is the fourth tallest  building in the U.S. and the 23rd tallest in the world. Inside the building is mostly  occupied by offices and stores.
 People can go to the top of the building, where there is an observation deck. From  the top there are beautiful views of New York City, especially at night. Most people  take one of 73 elevators to the top. It takes less than one minute by elevator to get  to the 80th floor. That is where there is a gift shop. Some people walk 1,860 steps to  the top. Every year there is even a race, with people competing to see who can walk  up to the top the fastest.
 The landmark is not just famous because of its height. In 1945, a small plane  crashed into it. More than 30 people have tried to kill themselves by jumping off the  building. In 1933 it was featured in the movie King Kong, where a giant gorilla climbs  to the top and falls to his death after being attacked by airplanes. The building was  also in the movie Sleepless in Seattle with Tom Hanks.
 At night, the top of the Empire State Building is lit up in different colors. It is red  and green on Christmas, red for Lunar New Year, and blue for Hanukkah. On the  Fourth of July it is red, white, and blue.

49. THE STATUE OF LIBERTY ENLIGHTENING THE WORLD
 Most people don't know that the full name of the Statue of Liberty is "The Statue  of Liberty Enlightening the World". She is a symbol of freedom, especially for many  immigrants. When many immigrants came to the United States in the late 1800s,  Lady Liberty in New York Harbor was a sign to tell them that they had made it to  America. Inside the base of the statue there is a plaque with a famous poem written  on it. The poem is "The New Colossus" by Emma Lazarus. Many immigrants feel this  poem speaks to them the reasons they came to America. One line of the poem is:  "Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free". Lady  Liberty was not always green. She used to be copper colored, but the years have  caused the copper that the statue is made of to change color.
 The 151-foot tall sculpture was a 100th birthday gift from France to the United  States in 1886. It is located on Liberty Island right off the southern tip of Manhattan,  New York City. The only way to get there is to take a ferry. Inside the base of the  statue is a museum. To get to the crown, people have to climb 377 steps up a double  spiral staircase from the feet of the statue. There is no elevator. People need to be in  good shape to climb to the top. People used to be able to climb up to the torch of the  statue, but it was shut down because it was too easy to fall off.
 About four million people visit the Statue of Liberty every year. People who can't  go to New York can see replicas in Las Vegas and other parts of the world.

50. ROCKEFELLER CENTER - TOP OF THE ROCK
 Rockefeller Center is a complex of 19 buildings. It is named for a famous New  York City business magnate, John D. Rockefeller, who built the group of buildings  from 1930-1939. The most famous building in the complex is the General Electric  building where NBC television studios are based. It is smack in the middle of  Manhattan, New York City, between Fifth and Sixth Avenues and between 48th and  51st Streets. The address of the GE building is 30 Rockefeller Plaza. That's how the  show "30 Rock" got its name. The show was filmed there. Saturday Night Live, a  popular American late night show, is also filmed there. Visitors can get tickets to see  a show being taped and can also tour the studios.
 Visitors to Rockefeller Center can visit the plaza, which becomes an ice skating  rink in the winter. Every year a huge Christmas tree is placed there and thousands of  people attend the tree lighting ceremony, which always features famous singers. In  the spring, summer, and fall, the plaza becomes a cafe. In the middle of the plaza is  a statue of the Greek god Prometheus. His myth states that he brought fire to the  world. 200 flags from all countries of the United Nations surround the plaza.
 Radio City Music Hall is another famous building in Rockefeller Center. Many  musicians give concerts here, but it is best known as the home of the Rockettes, a  dance company named for Rockefeller Center. They are famous for their kick lines  and are best known for performing in the Radio City Christmas Spectacular, an annual  musical holiday stage show.

51. MANHATTAN, NEW YORK CITY
 Manhattan is a small island that is one part of New York City. New York City, "the  Big Apple", is actually made up of five sections called boroughs. These boroughs are  Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn, Staten Island, and the Bronx. Manhattan has the most  people of all the boroughs, about 1.5 million, even though it is the smallest borough  by size. If you send a letter to someone who lives on Manhattan, don't write  Manhattan on the envelope. You should write "New York, New York", like the famous  Frank Sinatra song.
 Because the island is so small, most people live and work in tall buildings. Some  of these buildings are called skyscrapers because it looks like they are touching the  sky. Some famous skyscrapers in Manhattan are Empire State Building, Chrysler  Building, 70 Pine Street, Trump Building, GE Building, and Citigroup Center.
 Manhattan is connected to the other boroughs by a series of bridges and tunnels. The  most famous bridge may be the Brooklyn Bridge because of its brick arches. The New  York City subway, a massive mass transit system that mostly runs underground, also  connects the island to the rest of the boroughs.
 Manhattan, like the other boroughs, has many different neighborhoods, many of  which are named for the ethnic communities that first lived there. Some of these  neighborhoods include Little Italy, Little Germany, Little Brazil, Chinatown, and  Koreatown. One of the most famous parts of Manhattan is Times Square. Times  Square is called the crossroads of the world. Every year millions of people gather  there on New Year's Eve to watch an illuminated crystal ball drop. There are many  theaters around Times Square. Most of these theaters are on Broadway, a famous  street considered the home of the American theater industry. Another famous  Manhattan street is Fifth Avenue. A part of the avenue features expensive designer  stores like Tiffany's. Fifth Avenue is also famous for its Museum Mile.

52. LAS VEGAS, NEVADA
 For many years, gambling in the United States was legal only in the state of  Nevada. Nevada is a western state that is east of California, south of Oregon and  Idaho, west of Utah, and north of Arizona. It is a desert state where little rain falls  during the year. It is a little more than 275 miles from the city of Los Angeles, which  is where most of its visitors come from. Driving from Los Angeles is about four hours.
 Las Vegas, which means the Meadows in Spanish, was established by the Mexicans in  the mid-1800s. Much of what is now the southwestern part of the United States was  then part of the Mexican Empire. The city was a railroad town established in 1905,  and the first legal casino appeared in 1931.
 Las Vegas is now a gambling town, where people from all over the United States  come to vacation. Its population is under 2,000,000, making it the 30th largest city  in the country. Its original population in 1905 was only 5,000. Much of the city's  growth is due to the gambling industry. Many states have since legalized gambling,  including New Jersey, and California, but Las Vegas remains the No. 1 tourist city for  gamblers in the U.S. Today some of its largest and most beautiful hotels include  Bellagio, Flamingo, Caesars Palace, Treasure Island, Mandalay Bay, and Wynn. These  hotels are on Las Vegas Boulevard, which is commonly called "The Strip." With its  nearly year-round sunshine, beautiful casinos, and variety of gaming options, Las  Vegas remains the best location for gambling in the U.S.

53. MR. ROGERS' NEIGHBORHOOD
 Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood was one of the most successful and well-liked children's  show in the history of Public Television. Public TV differs from the more common  commercial television in that it is not funded by advertising revenue. Public Television  is a network of television stations throughout the country that is dedicated to  bringing alternative programming to the people of the United States.
 Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood ran from February 1968 through August 2001, and was  hosted by the show's namesake, Fred Rogers. It was a half-hour children's show that  featured the popular Rogers as host. It is often referred to as the Mr. Rogers show.
 Rogers began his show in 1953 on a PBS station in the northeast part of the  country as the Children's Corner. He performed as a puppeteer, and it was aired on  live television. There Rogers developed many of the characters that would become  famous as his show progressed. In 1967, his show went on the national TV stage,  and remained there until 2001.
 Rogers' style and calm demeanor made him an instant celebrity who was well liked by both children and adults. In his early life, Rogers studied to become a  Presbyterian minister, but didn't like how children's programming was being  presented. He began writing children's songs, and soon began his own local show on  public television. During the next three decades, Rogers became a true American icon  through his show. His great compassion, morality, and patience were possibly his  most liked characteristics.
 Rogers was not only a great TV personality, he was also a human rights advocate.
 He received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, as well as the Peabody Award for  meritorious public service. Rogers was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame, and  has received approximately 40 honorary degrees.

54. THE CINCO DE MAYO CELEBRATION
 The Cinco de Mayo, or Fifth of May, is a holiday celebrated by Mexicans in the  United States. Before 1776, much of the southern and western states, such as Texas,  New Mexico, Colorado, Nevada, Arizona, and California were part of Mexico. Following  the war between the U.S. and Mexico in the 1800s, these states became part of the  United States, but there still remained a very large Mexican population.
 The Latino population is the largest, single ethnic group in the country. It  accounts for 17 percent of the nation's population, and 63 percent of those Latinos  are of Mexican origins. The Cinco de Mayo is a large celebration in the country's  southwest region. It celebrates the Mexican victory in the Battle of Puebla, against  France on May 5, 1862. Curiously, the day is celebrated more in the United States  than it is in Mexico itself.
 In Los Angeles, the city celebrates the event with the Fiesta Broadway, which is  the largest Cinco de Mayo celebration in the world. More than half a million people  come to downtown L.A. to participate in the street fair that covers 24 square blocks.
 The celebration takes place on the last Sunday of April. There are rides, games, and  especially food at this celebration and it is growing every year. Los Angeles is not the  only Southland city to host Cinco de Mayo celebrations. The cities of Corona, West  Los Angeles, and Commerce also have events, and the famous Olvera Street  celebration in downtown L.A. is also very popular.
 One of the most unique Cinco de Mayo events takes place in the Hancock Park  district of Los Angeles. It is called the Single de Mayo. This celebration is an annual  charity event that began in 1999. It is a private party that benefits the homeless by  providing shelter and support. Cinco de Mayo is a truly American celebration.

55. THE ATTACK ON PEARL HARBOR
 On December 7, 1941, the United States of America was attacked by the Imperial  Japanese Navy at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. The surprise attack was intended to destroy  the American Pacific Fleet that stood in the way of Japan's complete domination of  the Pacific Ocean during the 1940s. The attack was coordinated with attacks in the  Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, and Hong Kong. Pearl Harbor was attacked by more  than 350 Japanese airplane fighters, bombers and torpedo planes that were launched  from six aircraft carriers.
 The early-morning attack sank four U.S. battleships, and four more were heavily  damaged. Six of the eight battleships were restored, and returned to service, but the  Japanese also destroyed, or damaged three cruisers, three destroyers, a minelayer,  and an anti-aircraft training ship. In addition, 188 U.S. aircraft were destroyed, with  many of them on the ground. The attack was devastating. It took the U.S. years to  recover from all the damage caused on that fateful morning. However, the Japanese  were unable to destroy their main targets, the Navy's aircraft carriers. By what some  call a stroke of luck, the U.S. carrier fleet was out to sea at the time of the attack.
 The country was in shock at the news of the disaster. U.S. President Franklin  Delano Roosevelt called the attack cowardly, and declared December 7th as "A day  that will live in infamy." On December 8, the United States formally declared war on  Japan. This plummeted the country into World War II, which Roosevelt had long  hoped to avoid. Soon after the United States' declaration of war against Japan,  Germany, which was a Japanese ally, declared war on the U.S. and the country was  now fully involved in the greatest war in the history of the world.

56. FUNERAL CUSTOMS IN THE UNITED STATES
 America is one of the most diversified countries in the world. It is comprised of  many different cultures from Latin America, Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is truly a  melting pot of diversity. All these cultures have come together to create a new culture- an American culture. Many of the traditions, customs, religions, and celebrations of  these cultures have been adopted into American culture, including funeral traditions.
 Traditional American funerals are basic. They usually include some sort of religious  ritual, followed by a procession to the burial grounds, and a small ceremony at the  grave site, but these vary depending on the culture. At most American funerals, the  deceased person's family sends out a death announcement called an obituary. These  obits normally serve to pass information to others about the deceased, and the time  and day of the funeral event. At the church service, the deceased is usually eulogized  by friends and family. This is where a person goes up to the front of the crowd to say  a few things about the deceased, and how he or she affected their life. The  procession usually takes the form of a caravan of private cars, and trucks that follow  the hearse, which contains the deceased's coffin, and remains.
 At the gravesite, another small ritual takes place where the deceased is given a  blessing from a member of the clergy. Friends and family are then allowed to say  goodbye to the deceased. There is an American tradition of picking up a handful of  soil, and tossing it on the coffin as a way of saying farewell to the deceased. The  family then gathers at a home, or restaurant with some of the attendees to have a  meal, and to exchange stories before going on their way. Most cultures in the U.S.
 have adopted this traditional American funeral ritual, but many include features that  are unique to their individual culture.

57. THE JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION
 One of the most significant dates in the history of the United States is November  22, 1963. That is the day President John Fitzgerald Kennedy was assassinated in  Dallas, Texas while riding in an open-air car. The president was visiting Texas for the  first time since his inauguration in January, 1961. Kennedy was one of the most  popular presidents in the history of the United States, and still remains so today. His  death shocked the nation for several reasons, but mostly because it was televised on  a live broadcast. Kennedy was the first president to appear on television at a time  when most Americans owned a TV. He was not the first president to be televised, but  previous presidents who appeared on TV did not reach the general public because  before 1960, not many Americans owned a set.
 Kennedy was warned not to ride in an open-air car that day by his bodyguards,  but he wanted the public to see him live. He did not want to be hidden behind an  armored car. According to the official government commission, Kennedy fell victim to  a single assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald, but many Americans dispute that finding to  this date. Police say Oswald shot the president from a building while Kennedy rode in  his car with his wife. The mood was festive at the time as the city of Dallas welcomed  the president to Texas. Kennedy was a handsome, young president who was the  youngest man ever to reach the presidency.
 Oswald later killed a Dallas police officer during his escape from the crime scene,  but was soon found hiding in a movie theater. He required police protection from an  outraged public, and was held in protective custody. Oswald, who was a former  member of the U.S. military, was unhappy with the president for his policies, but  never admitted to being the assassin. Conspiracy theories involving rival political  parties, the Cuban government, and organized crime have also been advanced as to  who actually killed Kennedy.

58. SOCIAL CLASS IN THE UNITED STATES
 Generally people's "class" is defined by how much money they make. In the U.S.
 generally there are three classes: poor, middle class, and rich. Some people also  think there is another class in between poor and middle class called working class.
 United States culture is based on the idea that people can move up the economic  ladder and become middle class or even rich if they were born poor. This is the idea  of going from "rags to riches". Moving up the class ladder is not easy though. Higher  education needed to get a good paying job is expensive.
 Class in the United States is more than just how much money a person makes  though. Education, what job a person has, where they live, and the culture, all play a  role in what class a person will be classified as. For example, a person with only a  high school diploma and a low-paying service job may be considered poor or low  class. While a person with a Ph.D., who owns their own company, would be  considered high class or wealthy. In a way this makes sense because high-paying  jobs usually require a high-level education. But for some people, class is something  you are born with. For example, the children of billionaire Donald Trump were born  rich and upper class without having done anything to earn that status.
 Gender plays a role too in how someone can move up the economic ladder.
 Women earn less than men do, so it is harder for them to accumulate wealth. Race  also plays a role in how much people earn and their ability to move up the economic  ladder. In the United States, most families require both the man and woman to work  in order to support the household.

59. ROSA PARKS AND THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT
 Rosa Parks is a prime example of how an ordinary American can change the world  around her. She was born in 1913, in the southern state of Alabama. Parks became  famous for challenging a discriminatory policy in the city of Montgomery, Alabama.
 During the 1950s, Black Americans in the south were not allowed to ride in the front  seats of public buses if a white person needed that seat. Blacks were expected to get  out of their seats, and go to the back of the bus, which was designated as "Colored  Only."  On December 1, 1955, Parks refused to obey the bus drivers order to surrender  her seat to a white passenger who had boarded the bus. Even though Parks was  seated in the Colored Only section, the bus was filled, and she was required by law to  give her seat to the white rider. Parks was arrested, and charged with civil  disobedience. She later said she had grown "tired of giving in."  Her arrest and subsequent trial made Parks a national symbol for the Civil Rights  Movement. Her arrest also lead to the Montgomery Bus Boycott that was a political  and social protest campaign against racial segregation. Although the boycott only  lasted 21 days, it was instrumental in the Supreme Court decision to declare  Alabama's practice of segregation unconstitutional.
 Parks has remained a symbol for the Civil Rights Movement even after her death  in 2005 at the age of 92. She has been called the "First Lady of Civil Rights," by the  United States Congress, and "The Mother of the Freedom Movement." She has been  honored by the U.S. government with prestigious awards such as the Presidential  Medal of Freedom, and Congressional Gold Medal. She has been honored with her  own museum in Michigan, and has received several other civil rights awards both  before and after her death.

60. CHICAGO - THE WINDY CITY
 Chicago is known as the "Windy City". Some people think this is because of the  breeze that blows almost constantly. The city is located in the state of Illinois on the  shore of one of the Great Lakes, Lake Michigan, which is the fifth largest freshwater  body in the world. Chicago may also be called the windy city because of the wind  tunnel effect created in downtown by many tall buildings.
 Skyscrapers are an important part of Chicago's history. The first skyscraper in the  U.S. was built in the city in 1884. At only 10 stories, it was impressive for its time.
 The skycraper was eventually demolished. Chicago is the home of other famous  firsts. It was the birthplace of the refrigerated rail car, mail-order catalogs, the car  radio, the TV remote control, the first Ferris wheel, the first steel rail road, the first  planetarium in the Western Hemisphere. Chicago is also the home to the first blood  bank and the first drive-in bank. It is also the home to The Lincoln Park Zoo, the  oldest public zoo in the U.S. Maybe the windy city should be called the city of firsts.
 Chicago is the third most populous city in the U.S., after New York City and Los  Angeles. A little more than two and a half million people live in the city that has more  than 100 neighborhoods. President Barack Obama used to live in Chicago.
 Nearly 40 million people visit Chicago every year. Many of them visit the Willis  Tower. Formally known as the Sears Tower, it is the tallest building in the Western  Hemisphere. It takes only a minute to get up to the 103rd floor Skydeck thanks to  some of the fastest elevators in the world. From the Skydeck visitors can see four  states: Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin.

61. BOSTON - A REVOLUTIONARY CITY
 Boston is the capital of Massachusetts. It is the largest city in the New England  state and is rich with history. This is why over 12 million people visit the city every  year. It is a very old city, founded in 1630 by English colonists fleeing religious  persecution. The American Revolution, when colonists, known as patriots, fought for  their independence from the British, began in Boston with the Battle of Lexington.
 Other key events in the revolution occurred in the city. One was the Boston Massacre,  when British troops fired upon protesters, killing five. The Boston Tea Party, when  colonists dumped an entire shipment of British tea into the harbor to protest taxes,  was not a party at all. Paul Revere's "midnight ride", where he warned colonists of  British troops approaching, also happened in Boston. Many of these sites can be  accessed by taking a walk down the "Freedom Trail", a red line of bricks embedded in  the ground through the city.
 Boston is also a city of notable firsts. America's first public school was founded in  Boston in 1635. Boston Common, where British troops camped during the American  Revolution and where early colonists hanged people, is the oldest public park in the  United States. Boston is also home to the oldest subway system in the United States.
 Like many cities in the United States, immigrants played a large role in its  development. Irish immigrants who settled in Boston, for example, played a large  role in both local and national politics. Boston also has a large and active Puerto  Rican community and Italian community. President John F. Kennedy and his family  have ties to Boston.
 Boston is also well known for many colleges and universities that surround it.
 Some of the most famous are Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
 Boston attracts more than 350,000 college students from around the world.

62. A NATION WAS BORN
 The American Revolution was a war of independence fought by those living in the  13 colonies of North America against Great Britain. Those living in the colonies were  especially angry about taxes the British were forcing them to pay. People felt taxes  were unfair because there was no colonial representation in the British parliament.
 One tax was the stamp tax, which taxed printed materials such as newspapers. The  colonists called this "taxation without representation". Colonists who wanted freedom  from English rule were known as Patriots. Those who supported British rule were  known as Loyalists. Before full scale war broke out, there were many acts of protest  by patriots, like the Boston Tea Party when Bostonians boarded British ships and  dumped 342 chests of tea into the harbor because of a tea tax. On April 19 the first  shots were fired in Lexington and Concord, Massachusetts, which officially started the  war.
 Many people were involved in the struggle for independence. Benjamin Franklin,  Thomas Jefferson, and John Adams worked together to write the Declaration of  Independence. On July 4, 1776, patriots declared themselves free. Most people know  George Washington was the first president of the United States. Before that he was  the commander-in-chief of the patriot army. Most of the battles in the American  Revolution were fought in the northeast in places near Boston, and New York.
 The British, known as redcoats because of their red uniform jackets, had help  from German mercenary soldiers called Hessians. Patriots had support from other  Europeans. France entered the American Revolution on the side of the colonists in  1778. This helped force the British surrender at Yorktown, Virginia, in 1779. However,  fighting would not formally end until 1783 with the Treaty of Paris when Great Britain  recognized the United States as an independent nation.

63. THE AMERICAN CIVIL WAR
 The American Civil War happened from 1861 to 1865. The main cause was  Southern states feeling that the U.S. federal government in Washington D.C. should  not have the power to tell them what to do. This was especially true about two  issues, taxes and slavery. The Southern economy was based on agriculture while the  Northern economy was based on manufacturing. Southern crops like cotton were sold  to factories and then Southerners had to pay taxes on the finished goods sold back to  them like clothing. Many Southerners felt this was unfair. Additionally the agricultural  economy in the south was reliant on the labor of enslaved Africans and their  descendants. Many people, especially from the North, felt this was wrong and that  slavery needed to be abolished. Southerners felt the abolitionists were threatening  their way of life. Seven Southern slave states, banded together, declared their  secession and formed the Confederate States of America. The government in  Washington D.C. and its army was known as the Union, since they were fighting to  keep the country united.
 Abraham Lincoln was president of the United States during the Civil War. The  President of the Confederate States was Jefferson Davis. The first battle was the  Battle of Fort Sumter. During the war President Lincoln issued the Emancipation  Proclamation, which declared the freedom of slaves in the Confederate States of  America. This action was supposed to show that Lincoln was still in charge of the  entire United States.
 The Civil War was the bloodiest war fought inside the United States. 620,000 were  killed and millions more were injured. One of the bloodiest battles of the Civil War  was the Battle of Gettysburg in Pennsylvania. 51,000 people from both sides died,  more than in any other battle. The Civil War ended in 1865 when General Robert E.
 Lee of the Confederate Army surrendered.

64. FIRES THAT CHANGED CITIES
 Fires are destructive. They also create changes. In 1871 a fire burned most of  Chicago to the ground. Many people think the fire was started when a cow knocked  over a gas lamp. Most of the city at the time was built of wood. This, combined with  the famous Chicago winds and a drought, made the city burn down quickly. The fire  lasted for three days. 100,000 people were left homeless, and at least 300 were  killed. What was amazing was how quickly the city was rebuilt, eventually becoming  the third most populous city in the United States.
 The Great Boston Fire of 1872 created a property damage of $73.5 million, more  than any other fire in the U.S. history. Most of Downtown Boston and the financial  district burned down in the fire that began in a warehouse basement. 30 people died,  and thousands lost their jobs and their homes. However, the city was rebuilt in two  years. It began enforcing building regulations because of the fire.
 The 1911 Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire in New York City caused the fourth  highest loss of life from an industrial accident in the U.S. history. 123 women and 23  men, all garment workers and mostly poor immigrants, died from the fire, smoke  inhalation, or falling or jumping to their deaths. Child labor was not uncommon. The  youngest victims were two 14-year-old girls who worked in the factory. So many  people died because the owners of the factory locked the doors to the stairs and  exits. This was to prevent the workers from taking breaks and stealing. As a result of  the fire and huge loss of life, many people began protesting poor working conditions.
 The U.S. Congress passed laws improving factory safety conditions. Women workers  also formed a union to fight for better working conditions.

65. A BEWITCHED CITY
 Salem in the state of Massachusetts is called the "Witch City", but don't be afraid.
 There aren't women wearing pointy black hats riding around on brooms. The New  England city is called the Witch City because of an infamous set of trials that  happened there in 1692 to 1693. At the time, the city was just a town in the British  colony of Massachusetts. The Salem Witch Trials accused more than 200 people of  being witches. People believed witchcraft was real and was criminal. Among the  accused were women, men, and even children. Nineteen people were sentenced to  death. They were all hanged. One of the accused was tortured with heavy rocks being  placed on him until he was crushed underneath the weight. Seven others died in jail.
 There was never any proof that those accused, and convicted were really witches.
 Historians think that people would accuse people because of family feuds. Other  historians think that a domino effect occurred, with people becoming hysterical after  one accusation. Fear of witches spread like a disease.
 The Salem Witch Trials have become a part of the city's history. "The Crucible", a  play about the trials by Arthur Miller, has been turned into a movie. The city is not  ashamed of its past, but rather uses it to teach tolerance and earn some tourist  dollars. There is a memorial dedicated to the innocent people who died because of  the witch-hunts. There is a "Witch Museum" that tells the story of what happened.
 Many people visit Salem around Halloween. Salem police cars have witch logos. A  local public school is known as the Witchcraft Heights Elementary School, and the  Salem High School sports teams are named the Witches. Films and television shows  featuring fictional witches have been filmed in Salem, including "Hocus Pocus" and  "Bewitched".

66. THE UNITED NATIONS IN NEW YORK CITY
 The United Nations, an international organization founded in 1945 after the  Second World War by 51 countries, has its headquarters along the East River in New  York City. Technically anyone who visits UN Headquarters is not in New York anymore.
 They are not even in the United States. That is because the land and buildings are  considered international territory. The United Nations has its own flag, its own post  office and its own postage stamps. There is no need to change currency, however.
 The UN uses the U.S. Dollar. Six official languages are used at the United Nations.
 They are Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, and Spanish. UN rules override  the laws of New York City. This does not mean that people can commit crimes there  and get away with it. There is no immunity to those who commit crimes there.
 The property where the United Nations now stands used to belong to a  slaughterhouse. The current buildings were completed in 1952. The perimeter of the  UN is lined with flagpoles with the flags of all 193 UN member states and the UN flag.
 They are arranged in alphabetical order in English.
 Some may think it's great to be a neighbor to a peacekeeping agency like the UN.
 Many New Yorkers don't always think so though. Every time a dignitary like a  president or prime minister visits, streets are closed, making it hard to get around  and to find parking.
 You don't need to be a diplomat to visit the UN though. There are tours Monday  through Friday and not just in English. Guided tours are available in English, French,  German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and  Swedish. Visitors can have a meal at the Delegate's Dining Room featuring a buffet of  food from all over the world.

67. NEW YORK CITY - THE BIG APPLE
 Apples don't grow in New York City, so that's not why it is called the Big Apple.
 There are many legends about how the city that never sleeps got its name. One story  says that a famous brothel owner named Eve gave the city its name. Another version  of history claims the name has its roots in show business with performers calling New  York the "Big Apple" since it was the best place to get noticed. There is one legend  that says the city got its name because of the large number of unemployed selling  apples on the streets of New York City during the Great Depression.
 The term more likely has its roots in horse racing from the 1920's. Prizes were  called "apples" and a newspaper reporter when writing about races often would call  the big prize the big apple. In fact, the "big apple" soon was used to mean any big  city. In the late 1920s through the 1940s, "The Big Apple" was not just a nickname  for New York, it was also the name of a song, a dance, and a place to dance and sing.
 New York City was the heart of the jazz music scene in the 1930's and 1940s. In  Harlem, uptown Manhattan, there was a club called "The Big Apple". There was also a  1938 short film of the same name featuring black jazz musicians and dancers.
 In the 1970s, the city tourism agency began using the term the "Big Apple" on  purpose. There is even a street corner in Manhattan called "Big Apple Corner". One  New York City baseball team, the New York Mets, have a big red apple that pops out  whenever the Mets hit a home run in their stadium Citifield. While the origins of the  "Big Apple" nickname are unclear, it seems to be here to stay.

68. THE WORLD TRADE CENTER
 The original World Trade Center opened in New York City in 1973. The most  famous part of the complex of buildings was the Twin Towers. They were named  because there were almost exactly the same. The only difference is that one had a  tall antenna on the top.
 When they were built, the 1,368-foot tall buildings were the tallest in the world.
 Such tall buildings needed a way for people to travel in them. The towers had 95  elevators in total. Visitors used to travel to the 107th and 110th floors, where there  were observation decks from which one could see the entire city and New Jersey.
 Inside there were offices, shops, a hotel, and on the top floor of one of the towers  there was a restaurant called "Windows on the World". The restaurant even hosted a  salsa night on Thursdays. A number of subway lines ran underneath the towers. The  World Trade Center Complex, with a total of seven buildings, was so large that it had  its own zip code. In 1974 a French man walked a tightrope between the twin towers.
 The World Trade Center survived a bombing in 1993. The skyline and spirit of New  York City were changed after September 11, 2001. That morning, two planes crashed  into the World Trade Center in downtown Manhattan. At first the top floors of the  buildings were in flames. Soon they came tumbling down, covering lower Manhattan  in hot metal and ash. A total of 2,753 people died. For weeks the air smelled of burnt  metal and plastic. It took eight months for the site to be cleaned. Years later, The  World Trade Center is rebuilding. There is a new tower, called the Freedom Tower.
 There is also a memorial and museum to honor those who died in the 2001 attack.

69. CENTRAL PARK
 Green isn't the first word that pops into most people's head when they think of  New York City. Yet, in the middle of Manhattan Island is the most visited park in the  United States, with 35 million visitors a year. Central Park, a National Historical  Landmark, takes up 843 acres of land. It is a green space where people go to escape  the noise and crowds of urban life. Before it opened in 1857, it wasn't an empty  space. People lived on that land. They were mostly poor free blacks, Irish, and Italian  immigrants. They were forced off the land to construct the park.
 One section of the park is called Sheep Meadow. Now it's just a grassy area where  people can lie in the sun, but actual sheep used to graze there from 1864 to 1934.
 The sheep from there were eventually moved to another park in the city. Many events  take place in Central Park, especially in the warm spring and summer months. There  is an outdoor theater, where Shakespeare's plays are performed. The plays are free,  which causes such high demand that people line up for hours before performances to  get inside. There are also free music concerts. Every summer a stage is set up. These  Summer Stage concerts feature musicians from all over the world. Both the New York  Philharmonic Orchestra and the Metropolitan Opera also host free performances in  the park in the spring and summer. There are also two small zoos inside the park,  and a number of small lakes in the park. One of the lakes rents out small mechanical  sailboats. There is also a puppet theater and a carousel for kids.
 The park is not dead in the winter. When it snows, families often go to sled or to  go ice-skating in an outdoor rink owned by Donald Trump.

70. THE MARLBORO MAN
 The Marlboro Man was a fictional character who appeared in several advertising  campaigns for the Philip Morris Corporation. His ads ran on television from 1964  through 1999, effectively entering the collective conscience of the American people  for generations. Philip Morris is one of the largest tobacco producing companies in the  world, and the corporation used the Marlboro Man with great success over the years.
 The Marlboro Man was a strong, rugged-looking man who rode a mighty horse,  and traveled throughout the country promoting tobacco products. He appeared in  television, radio, print, and billboard ads for decades. When the United States  Surgeon General deemed tobacco smoke as unhealthy in the 1960s, the beginning of  the end for the Marlboro Man had begun. The Surgeon General began an anti smoking campaign by requiring all cigarette companies to place its warning label on  each package sold in the country. The warning included the wording that "Tobacco  smoke can cause lung cancer." Soon the pressure was on the tobacco companies to  curb their advertising campaigns.
 In 1955, tobacco sales reached $15 billion in the United States alone. After the  Marlboro Man was introduced to the American public, that total reached $20 billion.
 This increase was largely based on the Marlboro Man campaign. The company also  started an advertising scheme by offering genuine Marlboro Man gear for sale. These  commodities were of high quality that appealed to the outdoor type of person. The  gear ranged from camping equipment, hats, to outdoor clothing. It was very  successful in its time. This success came at a great expense though. Four men who  portrayed the Marlboro Man died of lung cancer, earning Marlboro cigarettes as the  cowboy killer. The Marlboro Man is still popular in some parts of Europe and Japan,  where smoking is still in vogue.

71. THE BEATLES
 The Beatles are an English group of musicians from Liverpool, England. It took  America by storm with their appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show on primetime  television. The group's first appearance was seen by more than 73 million viewers in  February, 1964, introducing the band to the American people. In the months to  follow, the group became the biggest Rock 'N' Roll band ever to hit the United States.
 The group's success opened the door for other British bands to make their way to  America. Bands such as the Rolling Stones, The Who, The Kinks and The Dave Clark  Five were soon playing their music to American audiences.
 The Beatles were made up by four of the finest musicians to ever play rock music.
 Their lead singer was Paul McCartney, and drummer Ringo Starr. Both still play to this  day. Two of the original members, singers and songwriters, John Lennon, and George  Harrison, have tragically passed away, but their music lives in American culture to  this day. The Beatles have sold more records in the United States than any other  country in the world.
 There was controversy in the U.S. prior to the group's first appearance.
 Conservative Americans viewed the Beatles as upstarts, with brash, new ideas, lyrics,  and sound. The young generation of the time was ready for a change, and the  Beatles gave them what they wanted. They were nicknamed the "Mop Tops" because  of their long, bowl-like haircuts that flew in the face of convention in the 60s. Nothing  was going to stop the Beatles though. Their music is as popular today as it was 50  plus years ago. This February, the Grammy Awards presented a special telecast  celebrating the 50th anniversary of the group's first appearance on the Ed Sullivan  Show.

72. THE GRIFFITH OBSERVATORY
 The Griffith Observatory is a planetarium, and an exhibit hall located in Los  Angeles's Griffith Park. It features several astronomical displays and telescopes in the  Hollywood Hills in the Los Feliz district of the city. The Observatory was built on land  donated by Griffith J. Griffith in 1896. Griffith was a Welsh-born philanthropist and  mining tycoon, who wanted to give the public access to a state-of-the-art  observatory, so it was free of charge to visitors. He felt common people should be  able to enjoy the wonders of the universe, and not be solely for the scientific  community.
 Griffith donated 3,015 acres of land specifically to house the observatory that  opened on May 14, 1935. During the first five days after the opening, the  planetarium averaged more than 13,000 visitors a day. One of the major attractions  was the Foucault Pendulum that is designed to show the earth's rotation and the  Zeiss reflecting telescope. The observatory has a striking view of Los Angeles and  Hollywood, and the Pacific Ocean can be seen on clear days from there.
 In 2002 the planetarium was subjected to a $93 million renovation and  expansion, which closed the museum for four years. After it reopened in 2006, the  facility expanded underground with new exhibits, a cafe, a gift shop, and a theater.
 The Wilder Hall of the Eye section concentrates on the astronomical aspect of the  observatory. It is where people can view the stars through the observatory's  telescope, and features an interactive exhibit that is very popular. The Ahmanson Hall  of the Sky is another popular attraction for viewing images in the night sky that are  visible to the naked eye. The observatory frequently stages viewing nights when the  public is invited to bring their own telescopes. It is open daily, and remains free of  charge.

73. ONE COUNTRY, MANY RELIGIONS
 The United States is a country that has people from all over the world. Not only  do many people speak different languages, many people practice different religions.
 Most people in the U.S. identify as being Christian, but only half of those people  attend church on a regular basis. The second most popular religion is Judaism. The  third most common religion in the U.S. is Islam. Other religions practiced in the U.S  include Hinduism, and Buddhism. About 20 percent of all people in the U.S. say they  don't practice any religion. One of the founding principles of the United States is  religious freedom, which means people can practice whatever religion they want  without being discriminated against. This is even guaranteed in the U.S. Constitution.
 This is one reason why the United States has no official religion.
 Because there are so many different religions in the United States, there are  many different types of houses of worship. Christians attend churches. Jews and  Hindus attend temples. Muslims attend mosques. Many people use what they wear to  reflect their religious beliefs. For example, some Islamic women wear a scarf called  "hijab" to cover their head. It is disrespectful to ask a Muslim woman to take off her  hijab or ask for her to show you what is under it. Male followers of an Indian religion  called "Sikhism" usually wear cotton turbans. Again it is wrong to take a person's  turban off or ask that they take it off. Male followers of Hasidism, a branch of  Judaism, have long curls on the side of their heads. They wear a fringed prayer  shawl. Other Jewish men may wear a small cap on their heads called a yarmulke.
 This is supposed to be a constant reminder that God is above them.

74. WOODSTOCK: DEFINING A GENERATION
 The Woodstock Music and Art Fair, commonly called Woodstock, was an American  music and art celebration that took place from August 15 - 18, 1969. It was billed as  "3 Days of Peace and Music," and was a defining event for the young generation of  Americans of the time.
 The 1960s was an impactful era in American history. Many of the events that took  place during those controversial 10 years profoundly affect modern American society  today. The war in Vietnam was raging in the 60s, and the popular president, John F.
 Kennedy was assassinated in 1963. These are just two of the events that defined the  decade. There were many more historic events during that era that deeply divided  the country. Woodstock was designed to show how the young generation can coexist  with the older generation of Americans by living in harmony with one another.
 Although the event did not occur in the town of Woodstock, New York, the city has  become synonymous with the celebration. More than 400,000 young people gathered  at the dairy farm in the small town of White Lake, New York to witness music history  in the making. Rolling Stone Magazine listed the event as one of "the 50 Moments  that Changed the History of Rock 'n' Roll." Some of the biggest names in rock history  performed at the three-day event, including The Who, the Grateful Dead, Janis Joplin,  Jefferson Airplane, and Jimi Hendrix. In all, 32 acts performed at the outdoor festival,  and it was free of charge to all.
 Two soundtracks were released in the following two years. Both albums featured  the live performances with introductions. The documentary film "Woodstock" was  released in 1970, and received an Oscar in the Academy Award for Feature  Documentary category. It was also deemed a Culturally Significant, by the United  States, Library of Congress.

75. THE VETERANS ADMINISTRATION
 The United States Department of Veterans Affairs, more commonly known as the  Veterans Administration, is an organization dedicated to provide services for all  veterans of the U.S. military. It was formed in July 1930, and today employs  approximately 280,000 people at hundreds of its offices throughout the U.S. Its  annual budget for the 2014 fiscal year is nearly $153 billion, making it one of the  largest government agencies in existence today.
 The Department is broken into three main subdivisions. It consists of the Veterans  Health Administration, the Veterans Benefits Administration, and the National  Cemetery Administration. The VA Health Administration is responsible for providing  veterans with all health care issues, while the Benefits Administration is designed to  help veterans in areas such as guaranteed home loans, insurance vocational  rehabilitation and educational benefits. The National Cemetery Administration  provides burial and memorial benefits, and is entrusted with the maintenance of the  VA's cemeteries.
 Since that time, the VA has expanded greatly, and now provides additional  services such as educational benefits, and home-buying assistance. It also helps  those veterans who had become homeless after their service to their country ended.
 There are approximately 30 million military veterans living in the U.S. today. That  number represents nearly 10 percent of the population of the country today.

76. MARRIED WITH CHILDREN
 One of the most impactful television series ever to run on American TV was  Married with Children. The show aired on the FOX Channel for 11 years, and many  believe it was responsible for keeping the news station alive during the early years.
 In 1987, commercial TV in the United States was dominated by the big three: the  American Broadcasting Company (ABC), the National Broadcasting Company (NBC),  and the Columbia Broadcasting Company (CBS). When the FOX Channel appeared on  the scene, few people gave it much chance to survive in the face of its stiff  competition, but Married with Children changed all that.
 The show followed the exploits of a dysfunctional family that lived in a fictional  suburb of Chicago. The main character was the father, Al Bundy, who was a lovable  loser living with his self-centered wife, and bratty kids. Together, the family makes  Al's life miserable as he stumbles, and fumbles his way through life. Al works as a  shoe salesman that pays very little, and has little chance of promotion.
 Al is an endearing character who gained the adoration of the American public for  many years. The actor Ed O'Neil, who played Al, said that people still approach him to  this day calling him Al, or Mr. Bundy. O'Neil also said that playing the character for so  many years made it difficult for him to find work once the series ended because  people associated him with Al.
 One of the things that made the show so popular is that no subject was off-limits  to the writers. It was a controversial show that dealt with controversial subjects.
 Many people boycotted the show because of its racy content, but FOX continued on.
 The show has cultivated a cult-like following that began in the 80s, and continues  today.

77. FACEBOOK
 One of the most recent social changes taking place in the United States, and in  the world, is social networking. Social networking in itself is not a new development.
 These types of groups have been in existence for at least 150 years, and probably  longer than that. In the times before the invention of the personal computer, and the  advent of the World Wide Web, social networking was done in person. People who  had similar likes and interests would gather together to share experiences, make new  contacts, and promote themselves, or their businesses.
 On the Internet, social networking websites made their first appearances during  the late 1990s. The first major social networking website in the United States was  MySpace. MySpace was a comprehensive, social networking site that allowed its  users to exchange messages, share pictures, and make new friends in a way that was  never thought of in the past. With MySpace, people who did not go out much could  reach out to others from the comfort of their own homes.
 In 2004, Facebook was created. It was originally a website created for use by  Harvard University students, graduates, and faculty, but it soon expanded to include  just about everyone. Facebook is an elaborate social networking site that has grown  incredibly fast. It is now larger than some of the largest companies in the world. It is  a website that is in constant change. New features are added regularly. Facebook has  revolutionized the way people stay connected with each other and the rest of the  world. The way it works is simple. Users can set up a new account easily. All a new  user needs is an email address to start. Once a person has created an account, he, or  she can invite friends by sending a request out to people they know who also have  their own Facebook pages. Once you get started, making new friends will come  easily.

78. DON'T BE TARDY TO THE PARTY
 In the United States, people love to throw parties for many reasons. Of course  there are the usual birthday parties, but some people even have parties to celebrate  divorces! No matter what kind of party you are going to, it's a good idea to make  sure you are actually invited. It's considered rude to just show up unless the host,  the person giving the party, invited you. You will either get a paper, email or verbal  invitation to a party. Alternately, you can also go as a guest of someone else invited,  like as his or her date. Once invited, it is very important to let the host know if you  are actually going to show up. Many times hosts have a party catered, which means  other people prepare the food. They need to know how much food to have. Letting  them know if you are showing up or not helps the host and is considered polite.
 It's also important to be relatively punctual for a party. Most parties in the U.S.
 never start exactly when they say they will. Many people like to be "fashionably late",  that is, showing up about 30 minutes after the party is supposed to start. People like  to do this to make a big entrance. Showing up more than 30 minutes before or after  is considered rude though. If you show up too early, you are likely to interrupt  valuable preparation time of the host. If you show up too late, you are just being  rude.
 Even if it is not a birthday party, it is polite to bring a gift for the host. It doesn't  need to be a fancy gift. A bottle of wine, or even flowers, is polite and will be  appreciated.

79. A BRIDAL SHOWER
 A bridal shower is a party when a woman who is about to get married is  "showered" with gifts and well wishes. A bride-to-be will often register at one or  several department stores and create a list of things she would like people to give her  as presents. This makes it easy for guests of both the bridal shower and the wedding  itself to know what kind of things the bride wants. A registry also makes sure that  there are no duplicate presents. A bride may want a blender, but she sure doesn't  want to receive three and have to deal with the hassle of returning extras. Most  bridal shower gifts are items that a newly married couple needs to start their life  together. These gifts include dishes, pots, pans, and even appliances like toasters and  microwave ovens. Many brides also look forward to receiving some money. Cash or  checks are considered appropriate gifts for a bridal shower. The money comes in  handy to help pay for an expensive wedding. Sometimes people bring tasteless gifts  like lingerie to bridal showers. Some people think those gifts are good because they  help the new couple "spice up" their married life. Others find these types of presents  embarrassing.
 While many bridal showers are surprises, others are planned with input from the  bride-to-be. A bridal shower can be small and intimate and held in someone's home.
 It can also be a larger affair held at a restaurant or a catering hall. Sometimes snacks  and desserts are served or a full meal can be offered. Traditionally bridal showers  were women only affairs. However, more and more showers are no co-ed, with men  and women. Traditionally men are not invited to bridal showers but now more  showers include men and the groom-to-be. Like many parties in the U.S., there  would be no dancing at the bridal shower, just eating and people chatting. Some  bridal showers even have games.

80. A BABY SHOWER
 While many women are involved in planning their bridal showers, a baby shower  usually comes as a complete surprise. A baby shower is a party where a pregnant  woman is "showered" with gifts and good wishes. A baby shower is usually given by a  close female friend or relative of the mother-to-be. Sometimes co-workers of a  pregnant person will also throw a baby shower.
 The baby shower is usually given when the mother-to-be is between 6 and 9  months pregnant. Sometimes though, because predicting the due date of a baby isn't  always exact, a baby shower can happen after the baby is born. A baby shower can  be held in someone's home or outside, like in a restaurant or catering hall.
 Traditionally only women are invited to a baby shower. However, more and more baby  showers are also including the father-to-be. Like with a bridal shower, a mother-to-be  will often register a wish list of things she wants at one or several stores. This list  usually consists of things the mother wants for her baby including clothes, diapers  and even furniture like high chairs and cribs. This way friends and family members  can go to the store and buy something from the list. Registering helps make sure that  there aren't repeat items, like 30 bottles when a new mom only needed 15.
 Some baby showers also feature a paper mache wishing well. This is not just for  decoration. People can put cards inside with wishes for the new baby and mom. Most  of these cards also contain money or gift cards to help the mom-to-be buy whatever  else she needs for the baby. Sometimes there are games at a baby shower. In one  game everyone guesses the due date of the baby. Another game has people taste  baby food and guess the flavor

81. A HOUSEWARMING PARTY
 A housewarming party is a special party to be held when someone buys or moves  into a new apartment or house. The person or people who bought the property or  moved are the ones who throw the party. The party is an opportunity for friends and  family to congratulate the person on the new home. It also gives people a chance to  see what the new home looks like. It is an opportunity to fill the new space with love  and hopefully presents.
 It is traditional to bring a gift to a housewarming party. Some people register a  list of items they want or need for their new home at a local store or stores. Some  common items people will put on a gift registry include kitchen tools like knives and  items like curtains. Even if there isn't a registry, a good housewarming gift is  something to decorate the new house with like a piece of art or a plant. You can also  bring food or drinks to share with the other guests. This is often appreciated since at  a housewarming there isn't a lot of food served, usually just appetizers or  sandwiches. There are usually no planned activities like games at a house warming  party. The host or hostess of the party will, however, probably give all the guests a  tour of their new home. Sometimes, because a housewarming party happens shortly  after a person moves into their new home, people may be asked to help unpack  boxes. This isn't usual though.
 Housewarming parties get their name from the fact that a long time ago people  would actually bring firewood to a new home as a gift. This was so that the person  could keep their home warm for the winter. Now most homes have central heating  and don't use fires to keep warm.

82. THE WEDDING RECEPTION (1)
 The religious or civil ceremony that makes people legally a married couple is just  one part of the actual wedding. After the wedding comes the reception. A wedding  reception is a party held immediately after the marriage ceremony. Usually there is a  little bit of time, about an hour, between the ceremony and the reception to give  people enough time to travel from the ceremony location to the reception location.
 Most wedding receptions are held at a catering hall, which is a place that specializes  in hosting big parties. However, wedding receptions can be held in restaurants, parks,  and even in museums or zoos. A wedding reception is usually not held at the same  place as the ceremony, but sometimes they do.
 When guests arrive at the reception, the bride and groom are usually not there to  meet them. Right after the ceremony the newly married couple, the bridesmaids, and  the groomsmen will go somewhere to have photographs taken. While this is  happening, guests are usually treated to a cocktail hour at the reception site. During  this time appetizers and drinks are served. This also gives guests a chance to  socialize. After the cocktail hour, the main dining hall is opened. At a wedding  reception the seating is usually prearranged. Each guest will receive a card telling  him or her where they are expected to sit. Tables are arranged by numbers. In front  of the reception hall, there is a special table for the bride and groom.
 Once everyone is seated, waiters begin to serve salad or bread and drinks. Some  receptions have an open bar, meaning the alcohol is free. Other receptions have a  case bar, meaning non-alcoholic beverages are free; guests are expected to pay for  their own alcoholic drinks.

83. THE WEDDING RECEPTION (2)
 There can be different kinds of entertainment at a wedding reception. Usually  there will be a Master of Ceremonies, or MC, who helps move the reception along by  making announcements of what will happen next. For example, the MC will announce  when the newly married couple enters the reception hall, and all the guests will stand  up and applaud. A wedding reception usually has music and guests are expected to  dance. The music can be provided by a DJ or by a live band. Sometimes the DJ or  live band will accept requests from guests to play a certain song. When the newly  married couple enters the reception, they will share a dance by themselves to a song  they picked beforehand. Usually the song is something romantic and represents the  couple's love for one another. Sometimes the bride will share a dance with her father  and the groom will share a dance with his mother. After these special dances, the  guests are invited to the dance floor.
 Food at a wedding reception can be buffet style, where everyone serves himself or  herself, or it can be a sit-down meal served by waiters. Guests get to choose among  a meat, chicken or fish deal. Guests generally make their choices when they respond  to the initial wedding invitations.
 During a wedding, guests shouldn't expect to spend too much time with the bride  and groom. The new couple is usually very busy greeting all of their guests.
 Sometimes the couple doesn't even get a chance to eat. What almost every newly  married couple does get to eat at their wedding reception is the wedding cake. The  bride and groom traditionally cut through the wedding cake together, and then feed  the other person a bite.

84. BRIDE AND GROOM TRADITIONS
 There are many traditions that U.S. brides and grooms are expected to follow at  their wedding. One of the most well-known traditions is for a bride to toss her bridal  bouquet to the unmarried female guests attending her reception. According to the  tradition, the single woman who catches the bouquet will be the next woman to be  married. The flowers thrown may not be actually the same flowers the bride carries  down the aisle during the wedding ceremony. An identical bouquet is created for the  bride to toss. This is because many times the bride wants to keep her original  bouquet as a remembrance. Many women take the flower toss very seriously. There  have been videos documenting how women will sometimes even fight each other for  the bridal bouquet.
 The groom has something to toss at the wedding reception, too. One tradition is  the groom takes a garter from his new wife's leg and toss the garter to the unmarried  men attending the reception. According to the tradition, the single man who catches  the garter will be the next man to get married. Sometimes the groom will remove the  garter from his wife's leg with his teeth. At some wedding receptions, the man who  catches the garter has to place it on the leg of the woman who catches the bridal  bouquet. Some people think this is too sexual, and just skip this part. It is the  decision of the bride and groom.
 The bride and groom often toast each other with champagne before the end of the  reception. Sometimes a bride and groom will leave the reception before it is over.
 They go right to the airport to begin their honeymoon, a special vacation celebrating  their new life together.

85. THEME PARTIES
 Who says adult parties have to be boring. More and more adults are reliving their  childhoods or creating memories they didn't have as children by having theme parties  for their birthday or other occasions.
 Theme parties are based on an idea, a television show, a fictional character, or  really anything. Sometimes guests are expected to dress according to the theme as  well. For example, the Toga party is a type of theme party where guests are expected  to dress in togas, really just white sheets. Toga parties used to be especially popular  among college students. In a masquerade party, everyone wears a mask and has to  guess who is behind it. The mystery is part of the fun. Speaking of mystery, there are  murder mystery parties, where the guests have to solve a fake murder. Some adults  throw parties based on seasons. A summer beach party, for example, might feature  guests wearing their swimsuits. Another popular type of theme party is the game  night party. In this type of party, people get together to play various board games. A  variation of the game night party is the casino party, where adults play games  typically found in a casino-like blackjack or poker.
 Another theme party could focus on a specific region or country. For example, a  Mexican theme party might feature tacos, the colors of the Mexican flag and Mexican  music. Guests should be careful when dressing up for these types of theme parties  though. Dressing up like a certain ethnic or racial group is usually considered  offensive. It's better to just enjoy the food, and not portray a stereotype.

86. HELICOPTER VERSUS FREE-RANGE MOMS
 The parenting styles of parents in the United States are often criticized. One type  of parenting that is criticized is a helicopter parent. This kind of parents hover over  their children like helicopters, which means these parents are always on top of their  children.
 While being an aware and involved parent is not a bad thing, helicopter parents  take it to the extreme. The actions of helicopter parents actually hurt children, by not  teaching them to be responsible for their actions. For example, a helicopter parents  would call their adult college-age child to wake them up to go to class when part of  college is learning to be responsible and learning to manage your own time.
 Helicopter parents are also overly worried about their kids getting hurt. This means  helicopter parents hold back their child's natural curiosity. Part of growing up means  your kid has to get hurt, physically and emotionally. This is how lessons are learned.
 Instead, the kids of helicopter parents can grow up to be overly needy, dependent  adults. Some people blame the rise of helicopter parenting on the rise of cell phones.
 Mobile phones make it easier for parents to track their kids all the time.
 The opposite of the helicopter mom is the free-range mom. The free-range mom  follows a slow parenting style, meaning she lets her kids explore the world at their  own pace with little direction. The name free-range comes from the idea that kids  should have the freedom to explore their world or range in a way that makes sense  to them. This often means that free-range moms will not schedule activities like extra  classes or play dates for their kids. Instead a free-range mom will just let her child  play in a park. There is less of an emphasis on things like the latest toys.

87. ATTACHMENT PARENTING
 Having your kid physically attached to you probably doesn't sound like fun, but an  American pediatrician, William Sears, promotes a style of parenting that keeps small  children as physically attached as possible. This is called attachment parenting.
 The idea behind attachment parenting is that if a small baby feels protected and  safe by physical contact with their parent, especially their mother, that child will grow  up to be a more independent adult. One way parents are encouraged to be close to  their babies is by using a sling or a wrap to carry the baby around instead of putting  the baby in a carriage. This is often called "wearing" your baby. Parents are also  encouraged to sleep with their babies. Parents are too big to fit in a crib, so instead  parents are told to bring the baby into the adult bed. This is supposed to teach the  baby about sleep regulation as well since the baby will learn to mimic adult sleep  patterns. This co-sleeping is controversial though. There are concerns that babies  sleeping with adults could suffocate, accidentally get crushed, or fall off the bed.
 There is also concern about sudden infant death syndrome, or SIDS, where babies  just suddenly stop breathing.
 Another marker of attachment parenting is not worrying about spoiling a baby.
 Many times parents feel that paying attention to a baby's every cry makes them too  needy or spoiled. Attachment parenting feels that every baby's cry should be  responded to and that the baby should never be left to "cry it out." Instead, the baby  should be comforted and crying should be taken as a signal that the baby needs  something. Most attachment parents also breastfeed on demand, feeling that not  only is this physically healthier, but also promotes a bond between mother and child.

88. A KID'S PARTY FOR ADULTS
 Not all kids' birthday parties in the U.S. are created equal. Sometimes it seems  like the birthday parties are about showing off and entertaining the parents of kids in  addition to children.
 Most children's birthday parties are held in the home of the birthday boy or girl. It  used to be that children's parties were just for children. Parents would drop their kids  off and come back when the party was over to bring them home. Now it is more  common for the parents of guests to stay for the party as well. This gives the adults  time and space to socialize while the kids play games. Kids and adults don't always  have the same tastes in food. So when adults are invited to stay for a child's birthday  party, there is usually fancier food for the adults like cheese, crackers, and fruit  platters. Meanwhile the kids eat hot dogs and potato chips. While the children drink  punch, juice, or soda, the parents may be sipping cocktails, beer, or wine.
 Entertainment for a party of mixed adults and children also goes beyond the usual  clown or magician. Sometimes there will be a DJ, and the adults will dance. Party  games are not just for the kids, either. While the children play traditional games like  pin the tail on the donkey, the adults may play casino-type games like blackjack or  poker.
 Not everyone likes this trend of adults and children partying together. Some feel  that the parties should be kept separate. Some people worry about adults getting  drunk in front of the kids. Others worry about kids getting abused by adults they  don't know. For others, it is just about allowing a kid to have their special day. There  is also a concern that these mixed parties encourage a sense of competition among  parents in a community.

89. WHEN A KID BECOMES AN ADULT
 In the United States someone legally becomes an adult when they turn 18 years  old. At 18, U.S. citizens can vote. They can also serve in the military and go fight in  wars for the country. An 18-year old can also buy cigarettes and other tobacco  products, but 18-year-olds cannot buy alcoholic beverages. People in the U.S. need to  wait until they are 21 to be able to do that.
 At the age of 18, people can legally live on their own, work, and get married.
 However, turning 18 doesn't mean everyone is ready to take on adult responsibilities.
 At the age of 18, most people are just graduating from high school. Many will go to  college. Some young people choose to go to college far from their homes and live in  dormitories. Others pick a college close to home and stay with their parents to save  money. Yet others will choose to live on their own. Legally, a parent does not have to  provide for their child when the child turns 18.
 Some parents in the U.S. take this very seriously and expect their children to  move out as soon as they turn 18. Some parents will even forcibly kick their kids out  when the kids turn 18. There tends to be some difference about this depending on if  the kid is female or male. It is considered more acceptable for a female to stay living  with her parents after her 18th birthday. Many females aren't expected to leave their  parents' house until they get married. There is still an expectation for young men,  however, to go out and live independent lives as soon as they can. With the economy  of the U.S. struggling, some adult children are returning to their parents' home in  their 20s and 30s. These are called boomerang kids, since like a boomerang, they  return where they came from.

90. TAKING CARE OF MOM AND DAD
 In the United States, the baby boomer generation includes those that were born  in the time after World War II. Those babies are now reaching the retirement age. As  these adults age, many of their adult children worry about how they will take care of  their aging parents. In the United States it is not common for multiple generations to  live under one roof. Once children grow up and get married, they move out, leaving  their aging parents to fend for themselves. When these aging parents can no longer  take care of themselves because of age or illness, it is not uncommon for adult  children in the U.S. to place their elderly parents in a nursing home.
 A nursing home is a facility that offers care for the elderly and ill 24 hours a day.
 As the name suggests, nursing homes has medical nurses, doctors, social workers,  and therapists to help aging adults deal with the challenges of daily life. Most nursing  homes also have social activities for the elderly to engage in and keep active. These  activities range from games to dance classes, and movie nights. Nursing homes are  supposed to provide three nutritious meals for their residents.
 Nursing homes are controversial, however. There have been cases across the  country of staff in nursing homes abusing and even robbing the elderly residents.
 There are different states and federal agencies that are supposed to oversee nursing  home facilities. Some people feel that it should be the responsibility of family  members, especially adult children, to care for their aging or ill parents. However,  many adult children have their own children and families to take care of, and do not  have the means to care for their elderly parents; others worry about medical skills  needed if their elderly parents are seriously ill.

91. VACATION TIME
 The stereotype is that Americans are lazy, but studies show that people in the  U.S. get less vacation time than people in other parts of the world. A typical American  worker gets two or three weeks off out of a whole year for vacation. Most U.S.
 workers cannot take those two or three weeks consecutively. They usually have to be  spread out throughout the year. Even when U.S. workers are on vacation, they are  often expected to be in communication with their boss. This means checking in via  email and mobile phone. Most U.S. businesses do not encourage their employees to  take all the vacation days they are entitled to. In fact, most U.S. companies  discourage it.
 Other countries, especially countries in Europe, have much more vacation time. In  Germany many people have six weeks of paid vacation. At least three of these weeks  can be taken consecutively. Maybe this is why Europeans and other travelers vacation  in far-off exotic places. Most American families tend to stay closer to home, rarely  leaving the country.
 The difference in the amount of vacation time is legal. Most companies in  countries outside the U.S. have to give paid time off to their employees or else pay  hefty fines. However, in the U.S. there is no federal law requiring employers to give  workers paid vacation. In fact the U.S. is the only developed country that doesn't  guarantee yearly time off to workers. There have been efforts to pass laws giving  U.S. workers one week of paid vacation by law, but so far those efforts have not been  successful.
 Even when U.S. workers do have time off, many are afraid to take it because they  worry they may be seen as non-productive workers and lose their job. Other workers  worry about going on vacation and having a mountain of work when they return.

92. CAMPING
 Camping is a popular way for many people in the United States to spend their  vacation. Camping involves people leaving the comfort of their home and driving to  spend a few nights or more in the great outdoors.
 When people camp, they can sleep in a tent, a camper, or if they want to be  fancier, they can sleep in a cabin. Some people like to really "rough it" and use no  shelter except for a sleeping bag and sleep under the stars. Some people drive across  the U.S. in what is known as a recreational vehicle or RV, which is a trailer. Inside  there are beds, a tiny bathroom and a kitchen.
 There are campgrounds all over the United States. These are places where  campers gather together and usually pay a fee to pitch a tent or place a camper in a  designated outdoor spot. Many of these campgrounds have water hoses and electric  hookups so that people can wash dishes and themselves and plug in a radio or their  computers. Most campsites also have a fire ring or pit, which is a hole in the ground  where people can safely make a fire for roasting marshmallows, a popular camping  activity. There usually is also a picnic table for people to eat their meals. Many of  these campgrounds also have shared bathrooms complete with showers. Some  campgrounds have playgrounds, pools, and game rooms. Some also organize  activities for people who like sing-alongs, where people will gather together and sing  songs. Usually it is illegal to camp in a place not designated as an official campsite,  meaning you can't just pitch a tent in a forest.
 When people go camping they often do other outdoor activities like fishing,  canoeing, hiking, kayaking, swimming, horseback riding and mountain biking.

93. RENTING AN APARTMENT (1)
 Having your own space is a sign of success in the United States. However, renting  an apartment is not easy. There are a number of steps you need to take. First, you  need to figure out how much you can pay per month.
 When you first move into a new place, most landlords, or property owners expect  you, the tenant, to pay a security deposit. A security deposit is an amount of money  you pay a landlord sort of as insurance that you won't destroy their property while  you are living there. Usually the security deposit is equal to the amount of one-month  rent. If when you move out, the apartment is in the same condition as when you  moved in, the landlord will return your security deposit. If the apartment has any  damage whatsoever, including holes in the walls because you hung up posters, the  landlord can legally use that money to fix the apartment.
 Once you know how much you can afford, you can begin looking for apartments  for rent. You can look in the newspaper or online. Also walk around a neighborhood  you want to live in and be on the lookout for "For Rent" signs.
 There are two ways to rent an apartment. Most landlords rent out apartments on  an annual basis. This means you will sign a document called a lease, which says you  will stay in the property for one year and pay rent on a monthly basis. If you decide  that you want to break the lease, or leave before your year is up, there are usually  fines you will have to pay. Another way to rent an apartment is on a month-to-month  basis. This means that you pay by month, and are not obligated to stay for more  than a month at a time.

94. RENTING AN APARTMENT (2)
 Once you find an apartment you want to rent, you need to contact the landlord,  the person who owns the property. Most landlords are not individuals anymore, but  rather are companies that own a number of properties. You and the landlord will set a  date to view the place you are interested in renting.
 On that date you can see the apartment and ask questions. Some landlords will  require you to fill out an application. The application will ask questions about your  job, salary, and how many people are going to live with you in the apartment. The  landlord wants to make sure they have responsible tenants who will pay rent on time.
 Some landlords will even ask for references, the names and telephone numbers of  people who can verify that you have a job and are a responsible person. Most  landlords will also run a credit check. A credit check is your history of paying bills on  time. If your potential landlord sees that you owe a lot of money to different  companies and don't pay your bills on time, they may not want you as a tenant. If  you have bad credit or an unstable work history, you may be required to get a co signer, that is another financially responsible adult to sign the lease, a rental contract,  with you. This co-signer is legally responsible for paying the rent if you stop paying.
 If you cannot afford a full apartment, another option is to rent a room in  someone's home. The process to rent a room is like renting an apartment except you  only have a room and usually have to share the bathroom and the kitchen. Most  apartments and rooms in the U.S. are unfurnished. You are expected to bring your  own furniture, including a bed, a dresser, a sofa, and anything else you need.

95. WHAT IS IN A LEASE (1)
 If you want to rent an apartment, you need to sign a lease, which is a legally  binding contract between you and the landlord, the person who owns the property. A  lease is usually good for a set time. Some leases are on a month-to-month basis, but  most are for a period of one year or two years.
 The lease or rental agreement lists out your responsibilities as a tenant and the  landlord's responsibilities. The lease will tell you how much the monthly rent is, when  it is due, and how you can pay it. Some landlords will only take a certified check or  money order, and others will accept a personal check or cash. If you pay your rent  late, there is usually a late fee. The amount of the late fee is also usually in the lease.
 The lease will also tell you how much the security deposit is. Usually it is the amount  of one month's rent. The lease will tell you if you can have pets or not. Many places  do not allow pets. If you bring one in anyway, they can fine you or kick you out. If  your apartment does allow pets, most likely you will have to pay an extra amount of  money, called a pet deposit, to cover any damages caused by the animal. Other rules  that may be included in a lease include whether you are allowed to smoke inside the  property and whether you are allowed to make any changes like paint. Many  landlords do not allow you to paint or even make holes in the wall to hang up  pictures.
 A lease is proof that you legally live somewhere. Sometimes you need a lease to  show a school that you live within a certain area. Make sure you get a copy of the  signed lease from your landlord.

96. WHAT IS IN A LEASE (2)
 When you rent an apartment, you need to check the lease for rules and  responsibilities. For example, some landlords do not want you to have guests spend  the night. This is because the landlord doesn't know who your guests are. If they  damage the apartment in any way, you will be responsible. Also sometimes a friend  who wants to crash on your couch ends up staying for a really long time, and ends up  becoming another tenant.
 You are responsible for all the utilities you use while living in a rental apartment.
 This means you will have to pay for the electricity and gas you use. If the landlord  pays for any utilities, it will say so in the lease. Once you move in, you will have to  call the electric company and the gas company so they can put accounts in your  name. Also if you want a phone line, cable or Internet, you will have to call those  companies and pay for those services yourself unless the lease says that is included  in your rent.
 Your landlord is supposed to have access to the apartment you are renting from  them. This doesn't mean they can just barge in whenever. It does mean though that  with notice, the landlord is allowed to come into the apartment during a reasonable  time, meaning not in the middle of the night when you are sleeping. During this time  the landlord will inspect the apartment to make sure you are following the rules, and  the landlord can also make any necessary repairs. All of this should be written out on  the lease. If it is not, do not be afraid to ask the landlord to add that information. It  protects both the landlord and you.

97. PUBLIC HOUSING
 If you have a low income, are elderly, or are disabled, there are a number of  public housing options in the United States. Public housing options are run by the  federal, state, and city government agencies. Living in public housing is often called  "living in the projects", but this is a negative term based on stereotypes. Not all  public housing options mean living in huge, run-down buildings with lots of crime.
 Public housing programs come in all sizes and types. One type is a single-family  house. Another type includes living in a high-rise building, or apartments in tall  buildings. All public housing options are rental options, meaning you do not own the  place where you live.
 Eligibility for public housing is based on a number of factors. One factor is your  annual gross income, meaning how much money you make in a year. Another factor  is if you are elderly or have a disability. Another factor taken into consideration is  your U.S. citizenship or eligible immigration status. Most public housing options are  only available to U.S. citizens or U.S. legal residents. Like with any rental, your  references are checked to make sure you and your family will be good tenants. This  means looking at your credit history and your criminal record. People with criminal  records are usually banned or not allowed to use public housing options.
 To find out if you are eligible for public housing, you need to visit a government  housing assistance office close to you. You can find your local housing assistance  office by checking the yellow pages or by looking online. You will have to fill out an  application. On the application you will need to list the names, gender, and date of  birth of all people who would be living in the house or apartment.

98. APPLYING FOR PUBLIC HOUSING
 When you apply for public housing, on the application you need to give the names  and ages of everyone who will live with you. You will also need to give the address of  where you currently live and a phone number which you can be contacted with.
 In your application, you need to explain why you think you qualify for public  housing help. Some reasons can include being a veteran, being poor, or living in bad  conditions. Bad conditions can mean that the place you are living now is dangerous  or it can mean that you are in a domestic violence situation. The government will also  want to know the name and contact information of your current landlord and any  landlords you had in the past. This is so that the government can find out if you are a  good tenant. You will also need to tell the government how much money you make in  a year and how you make that money. You can't just make that information up. You  will need to provide your boss's information, old checks, and bank statements.
 The government may visit you in your current home and interview you and people  you live with. Other things the government will ask for are your birth certificate and  the birth certificates of all people who will live with you and proof that you pay taxes,  like a tax return. If you are eligible for any public housing assistance, you will get a  letter. If you're approved, you'll be put on a waiting list. You may be on the waiting  list for a long time before you actually can move into a public housing unit. This is  because there are many people applying and eligible for help. Sometimes you can be  waiting for years.

99. SECTION 8
 Section 8 is also called the housing choice voucher program. Very poor families,  the elderly, and disabled people can get up to about 2,000 dollars a month to help  pay rent in single-family homes and apartments. Families who qualify do not get a  completely free ride though. In order to qualify, you must be able to pay about 30  percent of the rent yourself. The rest of the rent is paid directly by the government to  a landlord. Not all landlords accept Section 8. If you qualify for Section 8, it is your  responsibility to find a landlord who accepts the program.
 Eligibility for the program depends on your annual income and how many people  are in your family. To qualify you have to be a U.S. citizen or a legal resident of the  U.S. If you are undocumented or have a tourist visa, you cannot apply for this  program. Like with all public housing programs, you will have to fill out an application  to see if you qualify. On the application you will have to say how much money you  make, how much money you have in the bank, and how many people are in your  family. You will have to give proof of how much you make. The government will ask  to speak to your boss, see your bank statements and proof that you pay taxes.
 If you qualify, you will probably be put on a waiting list. Section 8, like other  public housing programs, has many people applying for them. You could be waiting  many years before you actually get a voucher, which is like a coupon that says how  much rent the government is willing to pay for you. If a landlord accepts you and  your Section 8 voucher, you still have to sign a lease, or rental contract.

100. BASEBALL: THE NATIONAL PASTIME
 The game of baseball in the United States is the oldest major league sport in the  country. Major League Baseball traces its roots back to the 1880s, but the game had  been enjoyed by Americans for decades before then. The origins of the game are in  question. For many years a 19th Century American named Abner Doubleday was  credited with creating the game, but this has been proven inaccurate today.
 One theory is that the game was brought across the Atlantic Ocean during the  great European migration of the 18th Century, and that it is based on the British  game of cricket. Cricket is a very popular sport in England, but it is played by mostly  the upper-class members of that society, and it is unlikely that the poor immigrants  from England played the game very much. However, it more closely resembles the  game of rounders, which is another English sport that shares many common features  as the American game of baseball.
 In any event, the game became very popular in the United States. By the 20th  Century, the American League, and the National League were taking the country by  storm. The greatest single team in either league's history is the New York Yankees.
 The Yankees have won more World Series titles than any other team in history.
 The World Series is a seven-game competition with the two top teams from either  league. The first team to win four games is declared the World Series Champion. In  1903, The Boston Americans won the first World Series beating the Pittsburgh  Pirates. This was the start of an annual series matchup between the two leagues. To  date, the Yankees have won 27 championships in 40 appearances, with the team's  most recent title coming in 2009. The St. Louis Cardinals lead the National League  with 11 titles in 19 appearances, with its last title coming in 2011.

101. LEAVING FOR WORK
 At precisely 6 a.m., the sound of the alarm clock pierces the air. Sandy drags  herself out of bed and begins her morning routine with a quick shower. After her  shower, she prepares a simple breakfast. Grabbing a clean bowl from the dishwasher,  she empties into it a packet of instant oatmeal. She pours in a cup of milk, stirs and  heats the mixture in the microwave. While waiting for her oatmeal to cook, she  dresses for the day, mindful of the weather.
 Fully dressed now, she removes her oatmeal from the microwave, which has now  cooled just enough to suit her taste. It is her favorite flavor, apple cinnamon. As she  savors each bite, she is reminded of her mother, who always made sure Sandy ate a  warm breakfast before leaving the house in the morning.
 Checking the time on her phone, she hurriedly swallows the last few mouthful of  oatmeal before heading out. As she steps into the street, a gust of wind blows back  her hair. She covers her head with the hood of her coat, tightens the scarf around her  neck, and braces for her walk to the train station.
 After settling into her seat on the train, memories of her mother stir again. She  takes out her phone and texts: "Hey mom, thanks for the scarf you knit me. It came  in real handy this morning. Love always."

102. SHOPPING AT THE SUPERMARKET
 Pulling into the parking lot of the largest supermarket in town, Joe could already  see it was going to be a challenge to find parking on this Saturday morning. He  decides to first drop off his wife Melissa, so she could get a head start on the  shopping they need to do. Meanwhile, he battles to find a free spot amongst the  crowd of other waiting cars.
 Inside, Joe finally finds Melissa, whose cart already loaded with packages of  organic snacks and drinks. He knows Melissa is easily tempted by fancy words that  promise health benefits. It makes her feel good to know that she is making healthy  decisions. In the past, Joe would try to reason with her, explaining that health is not  about consuming specific items, and more about general lifestyle. Today, he decides  to simply move on. As the chef in the family, Joe looks forward every week to the  process of selecting meats and vegetables, imagining all the ways he can flavor and  cook them. Free samples are being offered at the familiar locations. Melissa makes  sure to hit up every station. They agree the chicken sausage is their favorite and buy  two packs. The buy-one-get-one-free fresh pasta attracts Joe, while the sale on  cheesecake draws Melissa.
 As they wait in line to check out, Melissa examines their overflowing shopping cart  and realizes that they are over budget. She puts back the snacks and drinks that  were clearly impulse buys, and happily claims she is learning to be a great shopper!
 Joe can only smile at the expression on her face. Five months ago when they first got  married, he never imagined he would enjoy these Saturday morning grocery trips.
 Now, he finds in them a peaceful satisfaction, a welcome change from his work all  week.

103. SUNDAY AFTERNOONS
 All week, Frank and Bob have been looking forward to Sunday afternoon. That is  when their favorite football team, the Philadelphia Eagles, plays their first game of  the season. The Eagles have a new coach, and many new, young, and talented  players. Football can be a very unpredictable game, with weather, injuries, referees,  and luck all affecting the outcome of the game. On top of that, new players and  coaches may need some time to learn to work as a team.
 For almost a decade now, Frank and Bob have watched Eagles games together.
 They met through work, but their friendship continues even though Frank left the  company a few years back. Their wives have become close and sometimes even join  them for the games. When their sons were still young, they used to be just as excited  about these Sunday afternoons. Now in high school, they'd rather hang out with their  friends than their fathers. Nonetheless, Frank and Bob have kept up their friendship  and this tradition, and couldn't think of a better way to spend Sunday afternoons.
 This week, they will be watching the game at Bob's house, who is anxious to show  off the new sound system he installed in his basement. As Frank walks up the  driveway, carrying a pack of their favorite beer, Bob walks out to meet him, already  dressed in Eagle's uniform. After some playful punching, they come together for a  quick embrace. Once inside, they are greeted by the familiar sounds of the pre-game  show. It's going to be a great season!

104. GRANDMA JOINS FACEBOOK
 Julie was sitting in bed late at night playing with her brand-new smartphone.
 Earlier that week, she had been visited by her children and grandchildren to celebrate  her 70th birthday, and had received the phone as a gift from her granddaughter  Mary. Julie had been widowed for five years now. Since she lived hours away from the  rest of the family, Mary thought the phone would be a good way for them to keep in  touch and take up some of her time.
 Up until then, Julie had never really been interested in catching up with modern  technology, but finally owning her own smartphone made her feel youthful, and she  decided to join Facebook since that was what she had noticed all the younger people  were doing. However, when making her profile page, she was embarrassed to put up  a picture of herself since she thought she looked much too wrinkly and nobody would  want to talk to her. To remedy this, she downloaded a picture of a beautiful 20 something year old from Google, posted it under her name, and went to sleep.
 The next morning, Julie woke up and enthusiastically logged into Facebook in  hopes that she would have one or two new friends. She could not believe her eyes.
 Her inbox was full of friend requests from dozens and dozens of young handsome  men that were complimenting her beauty and wanted to know all about her. Julie  decided to accept only the best-looking ones and began chatting with them day and  night, never letting them know that they were actually talking to a grandma. The  next time Julie met up with Mary, she thanked her so much for the phone and  remarked, "I haven't felt so young and pretty in years!" Mary was confused and  asked, "Why?" Julie just gave a mischievous smile and changed the topic.

105. BOWLING NIGHT
 Jennifer loved going out to bowl every Tuesday night. She always liked bowling,  but had never joined a bowling league until her friend Paul told her about a new  league one day. The two friends enjoyed going to Lucky Lanes on weekends, but had  to wait for the league games to finish before they could bowl. It did not bother them  since they knew what time the league games were over. Paul talked to the manager  of Lucky Lanes one day and discovered that a new league was forming soon. "That's  great," said Paul. "I'm going to ask Jennifer if she wants to join, too," added Paul.
 When Jennifer heard the news, she wasn't as excited as Paul thought she would  be. "What's wrong, Jen?" asked Paul. "I just don't know if I'm good enough to play in  a league," answered Jennifer. "Don't you have to be a good bowler to bowl in a  league?" Paul thought about it for a while before going back to the manager to ask if  the new league was for good bowlers, or anyone could join.
 The manager told him that this new league was for beginners, and added that  Paul and Jennifer would be some of the best players in the new league. Paul was very  excited once again. When he told Jennifer what the manager had said, Jennifer's  response was, "Where do I sign up?" This made Paul very happy.
 Before long, the two friends were bowling away in their new team and league. The  manager was right. Paul and Jennifer were among the best players. They both loved  bowling in a league. They got to wear team bowling shirts and hats, and all the  refreshments were included in the league fees. Soon they were knocking down pins.
 At the end of the season, their team won the trophy for coming in the first place!

106. THE HAUNTED WAREHOUSE
 When William worked in Santa Fe Springs, California, back in the 90s, he told me  he thought the building he worked at was haunted. "It really is," said William. "I have  had more than a few incidents happen to me while I was working alone, late at  night," he continued. William was working as a manager for a very busy chemical  distribution company at the time. In order to keep up with his work, he sometimes  had to work at night, or go in on weekends to catch up with his paperwork.
 William was a sensible man. He was not the type of person that would fly off the  handle in troubling situations. He was always very calm, and composed. This is what  made his story believable. I knew he wasn't the type to make things up.
 One night, William went to work after dark and thought nothing of it. His former  manager had told him that he might hear some weird noises coming from the  warehouse, but it was only the 55-gallon drums expanding and contracting. During  the heat of the day, the drums would expand, and at night, when it cooled off, the  drums would contract, sometimes making a sound. William was not worried.
 That night he was sitting at his desk when he heard what sounded like someone  knocking on the door leading to the warehouse. William dismissed it as a drum  "popping," and ignored it. A few moments later, the sound was back, and this time it  was louder. Since there was no one else in the building, he became a bit nervous, but  continued working. Soon the noises got louder and louder. The final straw was when  he heard someone walking above the ceiling of his office. This scared him quite a bit,  but again he ignored it. Finally, it happened again, and this time William ran into the  warehouse to look above his office, but no one was there. After that, William never  worked at night again.

107. MOVING TO ARIZONA
 Jerry was seventeen when his family decided to move out their apartment in the  city of Riverdale. They had lived there for nearly ten years. In those ten years, Jerry  had made dozens of friends from around the city. He didn't understand why they had  to move. Jerry wished he could stay behind while his family left to Arizona. He knew  things weren't ever going to be the same if he left Riverdale, California.
 "Why do we have to move?" Jerry would ask, sounding depressed. His parents  had answered that question countless times already. Despite knowing the answer,  Jerry was reluctant to believe it, so he kept asking. "Why do we have to move?" Jerry  asked time after time. The simple truth was that Jerry and his family just could not  afford to live in Riverdale any longer. It was hard for Jerry to accept that truth.
 On the day before the move, Jerry walked around the familiar places in Riverdale.
 He walked passing the oak tree where he first kissed a girl. He walked past the  corner mini-market where he would bring back milk every Sunday. He passed by his  high school where he had learned and discovered his love of math and science.
 Jerry knocked on the doors of friends' houses to say one final goodbye. "Good  bye, Tom," Jerry told his best friend. "Goodbye Jane," Jerry told his girlfriend. The  night fell when Jerry finally finished bidding his farewells to everybody he knew.
 "Goodbye, Riverdale," Jerry said, looking out his bedroom window as he went to  sleep. That night, Jerry dreamed of moving to Arizona and making friends on the first  day there. Everything in Arizona seemed great in his dream. The following morning  when he awoke, Jerry no longer felt so bad about moving. "Everything is going to be  all right," Jerry said to himself as he stepped into the moving van on his way to  Arizona.

108. WORKING AT A BOOKSTORE
 Joel had been working at a bookstore for four months. Although four months  might seem like a long time, Joel felt like it had been only one month since he was  hired. Working at a bookstore was a dream job for Joel. He couldn't believe he got  hired on the day of his interview. Joel felt grateful to be working at where he was. He  loved to brag all about his job to his friends and family.
 Joel loved reading books on his spare time. His favorite author was Mark Twain.
 Joel's most beloved book of his was "The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn". Working at  a bookstore not only gave Joel access to books, but allowed him to interact with other  fellow book worms. Joel often would recommend books to customers, and customers  would do the same for Joel. Every now and then, he would come across a classic  book and take it for himself to read. Joel's manager allowed him one book for free  once a week. It was difficult to decide which book to take sometimes.
 Joel was getting paid three hundred dollars every two weeks. Sometimes he  would surpass this amount when he worked overtime. After a couple of months, Joel  had saved up enough money to finally purchase his first car. Buying a car was the  main reason Joel wanted to start working. He began shopping online for used  vehicles.
 Joel already knew what kind of car he wanted. He had first seen a picture of it in a  magazine, and since then, had dreamed of owning one of his very own. His dream  car was 1984 BMW. Joel wanted a black one with two doors. He would search on the  Internet until he finally found it. Joel could not believe when he discovered a seller  with the car.

109. JOEL LEARNS TO DRIVE
 Learning to drive seemed scary for Joel at first. He had recently purchased his  first car, which was now sitting on his driveway, looking clean and shiny. The previous  owner had maintained it for years and had spent a lot of money restoring it to its  original condition. The car was a BMW, made in the year 1984. It was black and had  only two doors. The interior was also black and had leather seating. The vehicle  looked practically new to Joel, despite it being older than the new owner of it.
 Joel was eager to start driving his new car. At 21, Joel had felt the need to be  driving already. He was attending college in the city of Los Angeles, working at a  bookstore in the city of Montebello, and living in the city of Bell. Having a car would  make traveling much more convenient. Joel had been getting around by means of  public transportation. He was ready to stop taking the bus to school and work.
 The first thing Joel had to do was to go to DMV to register the car under his  name. After that, he took a driving manual book from DMV to study for the written  test. Passing the written test was the only way to get a driving permit. Joel studied  for a few days, and passed his test. With the permit in hand, Joel next had to find  someone to teach him how to drive.
 Joel already knew who to ask for driving lessons. "If I'm going to teach you how  to drive, you're going to have to commit 100 percent. Do you understand?" Joel's  uncle asked him. "Yes, sir," responded Joel. After a month full of trial and error, Joel  finally learned how to drive his car. Although it was scary at first, driving eventually  became easy enough for Joel.

110. GHOST IN THE HALL
 "Do you believe in ghost?" Alvin asked his brother Levi one night, as they were  lying down in bed around eleven at night. "I don't think so," Levi replied. Alvin and  Levi shared a room together. "Why not?" asked Alvin. "I have never seen one," Levi  said. Alvin was twelve years old and Levi was eighteen. "I think I saw one, Levi,"  Alvin told his brother, sounding frightened. "Go to sleep, Alvin," Levi told his brother,  as he turned around in his bed to face the closet. "There's no such thing as ghost,"  Levi said.
 Alvin and Levi were lying on separate beds. Levi had fallen asleep half an hour  ago, but Alvin was still awake. He was having a hard time trying to go to sleep. A  sound was keeping him awake. It sounded like someone was walking out in the  hallway, right outside his bedroom door. It was completely dark.
 Alvin was curious to find out who was sauntering out in the hallway. Fifteen  minutes had passed and the creaking hadn't stopped. Alvin slowly rose from his bed.
 He moved towards his door, taking one step every two seconds. When he finally  reached his door, he put his hand on the doorknob and gradually began to turn it. The  walking had not ceased.
 "Alvin, what are you doing?" Levi said right before Alvin could open the door. "I  think there's a ghost in the hallway," Alvin replied. Levi rose to his feet and went to  the door. "I'll go with you." Levi said. The two opened the door together and popped  their heads out the door to take a look. "You see, it was nothing," Levi said. Alvin and  Levi went back to bed. Levi again fell asleep before Alvin. Alvin could not go to sleep.
 There was someone walking in the hallway.

111. BOBBY THE FAT BOY
 Bobby loved to eat. He ate hamburgers, French fries, hot dogs, pizza, donuts, and  ice-cream, just to name a few. No matter how much Bobby ate, he never got a  stomachache. It is no surprise that Bobby weighs two hundred and fifty pounds. It  might be surprising to know that Bobby is only fifteen years old. Bobby didn't care  that he was big. He was content with how he looked and loved eating as much as he  could.
 Bobby liked to tell jokes to his friends. "Knock, knock," Bobby would say. "Who's  there?" friends would ask. "Gorilla," Bobby replied. "Gorilla who?" they'd ask back.
 "Gorilla me a hamburger!" Bobby replied, delivering the punch line. The joke was in  how the word gorilla sounded like grill. Bobby's joke always left people in stitches.
 Even though Bobby was popular and friendly, he was still teased by some kids in  school. Fat boy Bobby was the nick name the mean kids gave to Bobby. Whenever  Bobby heard the nick name, he would reply with gusto, "sticks and stones may break  my bones, but words can never hurt me." The bullies would funnily reply, "I bet you  would eat those sticks and stones, fat boy Bobby!" and scurry off running.
 Bobby did not let idiotic name calling bother him. He had more important things  to think about, like what he was going to eat for dinner. Bobby knew that one day he  would have to lose weight if he wished to live a longer life. Until that day came,  Bobby would continue eating what he wanted and as much he wanted.

112. FIFTH GRADE DANCE COMPETITION (1)
 Jenny is a fifth grader. She is considered one of the most popular girls in her  class. She is very pretty, but that is not why she is considered popular. She is popular  because she is known to be among the brightest in her class. She can do the most  cartwheels in a row, but mostly, she has the talent to dance.
 Last year, she entered the school's dance competition and won the first place. Her  whole class was there to support her. Since that day, she has been the class  attraction. This year, the school is holding another dance competition, but there has  been a change in this year's competition. The competition has to be done in pairs.
 Jenny's class was looking up to her with high expectations of her winning again  this year. On the other hand, Jenny was unsure of this year's outcome. She wanted to  enter the competition, but she had never danced with a partner before. She decided  to ask some of the boys in her class to enter with her. They all said no to her because  they did not know how to dance. Jenny was becoming hesitant about joining.
 She finally decided to turn to one of her closest friends, Carl. Jenny and Carl had  known each other since the first grade. Carl was reluctant to join at first because he  also didn't know how to dance. Jenny insisted. He eventually agreed to join the  competition. Jenny was happy and relieved. However, she was still worried because  she knew her class was counting on her to win this year's competition.
 All she needed was some time and practice in order to increase her chances of  winning. This time, it was going to be more of a challenge considering the fact that  Carl was not a good dancer. The competition was in two months, and only time could  predict her chances of winning.

113. FIFTH GRADE DANCE COMPETITION (2)
 After selecting Carl as her partner, Jenny needed to start planning for the dance  competition at her school. The competition started in two months. Jenny was aware  that Carl was not a great dancer. She had to dedicate some time in helping him  improve his skill. On the first few days of preparation, Jenny had planned out their  dance routine, with the help of her teacher. They were going to be dancing to  "Jailhouse Rock" by Elvis Presley.
 Jenny and Carl spent the first two weeks memorizing their steps and cues to their  dance. Carl was pretty clumsy at first. He eventually got the hang of it. They spent  the rest of the time perfecting their moves. The day of the competition was almost  near. Jenny and Carl were beginning to get nervous. They were going up against nine  other pairs from the same school.
 The day of the competition arrived. Carl had not become a great dancer, but had  definitely improved since he began. Since Jenny won last year's competition, she was  to perform with Carl last. The pairs that were performing this year were better  dancers compared to last year's competition. As each pair took the stage one by one,  Jenny grew more anxious. Carl noticed this from Jenny and told her, "It'll be okay,  Jenny. You are great, and I'm sure we'll win." Jenny felt better after hearing Carl's  words. Soon, it was their turn to perform. They walked on stage and began to dance  as soon as their song started to play.
 They were off to a great start. Jenny's class was there cheering them on. The  crowd began cheering them on as well. Suddenly, Jenny tripped and fell. The crowd  was shocked. Carl managed to get Jenny back up on time for their big finale. Jenny  was upset because of her fall. After their performance, the judges tallied up the  scores and were ready to announce the winner. Jenny and Carl won, but it was a  close call. If it wasn't for Jenny's talent and Carl's quick thinking to keep the routine  going, they wouldn't have won. They were both awarded with a trophy and medals.
 Jenny and Carl were full of cheer.

114. CAMPING TRIP
 It is the first day of the summer. George and his friend Carlos are planning on  going on a camping trip. It is going to be the best camping trip, which will last three  days. While Carlos makes invitations for their friends, George is going to make a list  of activities to do while they are there. Last year, their camping trip was not entirely  a success.

 This year, they plan to go prepared. George is going to take a spare tire and gas,  just in case they run out.

115. PAINTING A MURAL
 Anna woke up late one morning. She was supposed to meet up with a group of  friends that morning at 8 o'clock. She woke up at 8:15 instead. Anna rushed to get  ready. She quickly showered, put on her clothes. Then, she grabbed her tool box and  headed out on her bike.
 Anna and her friends were asked to paint two murals for the city's library. One of  the murals was to be located on the outside, and the other on the inside. The owner  of the library was the one who requested these murals. The reason was because he  was a fan of Anna's art, and was planning to remodel the library.
 Both murals were going to be painted with a similar theme. They were both going  to be paintings aimed to inspire people to read. Anna already had her ideas for both  murals planned out. It was going to be colorful. Her friends were going be there to  help paint the large areas of the mural.
 Once Anna arrived, she noticed her friends waiting outside the library. Anna  apologized for being late. She pulled out her ideas to show to her friends. Her friends  were impressed and excited to begin painting. They first started by outlining the  images of the ideas onto both walls. Next, they mixed their colors and began to  paint. Painting the mural was a lot faster to do when you have the help of your  friends. They finished both murals within two days.
 The new murals attracted the attention of local visitors to the library. The owner  of the library was impressed and happy with the new look of his library. He awarded  Anna and her friends with recognition and paid them for their labor. Anna was  pleased.

116. NEW YORK, NEW YORK
 Two years ago, Amy left her small hometown in England and moved to one of the  biggest cities in the United States -- New York. Amy knew the transition would be  difficult at first, but was confident that she would love her new life and succeed in  becoming a Broadway star. She had envisioned herself getting off the airplane and  immediately making new friends with whom she would spend her nights exploring  The City That Never Sleeps.
 Unfortunately, the reality of Amy's situation was far from the perfect life she had  imagined. Her days were spent jumping from theatre to theatre looking for auditions.
 Although she was very pretty, and great at acting, her accent made it difficult for her  to get hired for any roles. Directors kept telling her to work on her American accent,  but the more she practiced it, the more she sounded like a cowboy rather than a New  Yorker.
 Amy's nights were spent working at a diner in order to pay for her ridiculously  expensive one-room apartment where the sinks always leaked and the hot water  never worked. To top it all off, the city that she had imagined as being filled with and  friendly faces bright lights like in the movies was made up mostly of smelly alleys, big  rats, and angry crowds that were always in a hurry to get somewhere. Still, Amy  didn't let anything crush her spirits, and was determined to keep working hard until  her dreams would come true.
 Finally one day, Amy was clearing some tables in the diner while singing her  favorite song as usual. "Excuse me," said a man in a nearby booth. "I couldn't help  but notice that you have a beautiful voice." Amy blushed and thanked the man. "I'm  actually casting for a star in my new Broadway musical of Mary Poppins," he  continued. "How would you feel about acting?" Amy's heart raced with excitement  just as Frank Sinatra's "New York, New York" began playing on the diner's jukebox.
 She was finally going to make it.

117. NOT-SO-HAPPY MEALS
 John is a busy lawyer, whose whole day revolves around two things: work and his  two daughters. Balancing the two things often proves to be very difficult, so John  spends most of his day in a rush to do everything he needs to do, and get  everywhere he needs to be. With such a hectic schedule, it is common to find John  and his children in line at a McDonald's drive-thru, waiting for some burgers, fries,  and shakes.
 "I know fast food isn't the healthiest thing I could give my daughters," admits  John. "But it's the most convenient thing around when we're in a rush. Plus, it makes  them happy." Unfortunately, this attitude towards the unhealthiness of fast food is  one that so many parents in the U.S. hold, and it is easy to understand why.
 Nowadays, nearly every single city in America is equipped with its own  McDonald's. In Los Angeles alone, it can sometimes feel like there is one on every  other corner when you're driving around. As if this didn't already make it hard  enough for parents to avoid, McDonald's targets their famous "Happy Meals" to  children so that every time they drive by the giant golden arches, children demand to  go inside to get a new toy with their meal.
 Although it may be very hard for parents to have healthier meal options for their  children, doing so is a necessity that this country can no longer ignore. Constantly  consuming fast food is becoming a norm in American society and is resulting in  millions of people suffering from obesity and diabetes for the rest of their lives.
 Instead of teaching children that it is okay to give in to the temptation of a quick  greasy meal, parents should get their children into the habit of healthy eating  everywhere they go. In the end, children will be more thankful for living long,  healthy, and happy lives, than for getting a cheap toy in a cardboard box.

118. THE BAD NEWS
 David and Melissa had been a happily married couple for six years. They lived a  comfortably modest life in a small apartment and had been saving up for years in  preparation for the next giant step in their life: a baby. However, after repeatedly  trying to get pregnant for a whole year, they consulted a doctor and received  devastating news. Melissa would be unable to conceive a child for the rest of her life.
 The bad news struck Melissa terribly hard. Seeing his wife in such a distraught  and depressed state broke David's heart. "Don't worry," he told her. "I'm going to  make you the happiest woman in the planet, even if it's just the two of us." He then  went to the bank, took out all their savings that had been held for the baby, and set  out to do whatever he could to cheer his wife up.
 Since they no longer had to be careful with how much money they spent, David  began splurging on everything he could think of. First, he took Melissa shopping for  the finest and most beautiful clothes she could dream of. Then, they took an exotic  vacation to the Florida Keys, where they spent a month exploring every island and  spending thousands of dollars on the most beautiful hotels, and most delicious foods  they could find.
 When they finally returned home. Melissa said, "Oh, David! Everything is perfect!
 I'm actually glad we don't have a child." David smiled, content with his wife's  happiness, and walked over to check their voicemails from when they were away. The  machine bleeped and then their doctor's voice came on saying, "Hi guys. Great news!
 There was a mistake in the test results. You are actually six weeks pregnant! It's  Triplets."

119. THE BIG MOVE
 Andrea's big day was finally here. She had been accepted into the medical school  of her dream in Boston, and was about to fly there to begin her new life. She had  gotten the news of her acceptance two months ago, but had spent all that time so  busy preparing for the move that she hadn't had time to realize how nervous she  really was. It wasn't until it was time for her to get up from the plane seat that she  realized her legs were shaking, her heart was racing, and her forehead was sweating.
 "Keep calm!" she kept repeating to herself the whole way to her new apartment.
 She had worked so hard to get here, and she knew that she had nothing to be afraid  of. Still, as she looked out of her new living-room window, the world outside looked  much too scary to face. Having grown up on the West Coast her whole life, she was  not prepared for how everything looked here. The warm, bright sun that she was so  used to seeing out this time of year was nowhere to be seen. Everyone's accents  seemed completely unfamiliar, and the people even seemed taller than normal.
 She decided to stay in the safety of her apartment that night and didn't go  outside until it was time for her class the following afternoon. As the professor asked  some basic questions to see what level everyone was at, Andrea's mind went  completely blank. "Oh no!" she thought to herself. "I'm not even supposed to be  here! Everyone knows so much more than me." Just then, the professor pointed at  her and asked her a question about the functions of the spinal cord. As frightened as  she was, the answer was just blurted out of her mouth instinctively. "Impressive!"  says the teacher. "You'll do just great here." she assured her. As the teacher walked  away, one of the pesky giant ants crawled across Andrea's desk. She quickly flicked it  off the edge, and then smiled confidently.

120. THE DENTIST WILL SEE YOU NOW
 Making an appointment to see the dentist is usually one of the smartest decisions  a person could make for his or her health. However, for Marek, booking his dentist  appointment ended up being one of the worst mistakes in his life. This was because  of the fact that the dentist Marek chose to visit was his ex-girlfriend whom he had  recently broken up with to be with another woman. This silly mistake resulted in  Marek walking out of the dentist's office with all the 32 teeth missing.
 "I didn't have any reason to doubt her," says Marek. "I mean I thought she was a  professional." Quite on the contrary, his ex-girlfriend decided that this was the perfect  chance to get her revenge for having been heart-broken. She gave him a heavy dose  of anesthesia, pulled out all of his teeth, and bandaged his whole face up with gauze  so that her work wouldn't be noticed until the bandages were all pulled off. "The  bandages are to protect your gums," she told Marek, who then left the office, still  heavily numbed by the effects of the anesthesia.
 As the anesthesia wore off on his way home, he could tell something was terribly  wrong because he couldn't feel any teeth. One can only imagine the panic he must  have felt after uncovering his ex's work under all the gauze. After reporting the event  to the police, his ex is now facing the possibility of three years in prison for a doctor's  malpractice suit. On the bright side for her, she might be spending those three years  behind bars pleased at knowing that her shocking stunt was very effective in terms of  getting even with Marek. After seeing that he no longer had any teeth, his new  girlfriend broke up with him.

121. THE LOTTERY TICKET
 An 85-year-old woman in Tennessee named Astrid became a multimillionaire  overnight after winning a $500 million lottery jackpot. However, her road to richness  was not all completely smooth. Her story reminds us that in order to win the lottery,  there are two crucial requirements. The first and most obvious necessity is a lot of  luck. The second requirement is just as important, but much less often mentioned - getting organized.
 Astrid's story began when getting in line for a lottery ticket at her local  supermarket. The woman ahead of her decided to let her cut in front of her to pay.
 This woman was also planning on buying a lottery ticket. Had she not given Astrid  her spot in the line, the lottery money would have been hers!
 On the day that the winners were announced, Astrid realized she had won, she  could not contain her excitement. She danced with joy all around her house and  jumped on the phone to tell her closest relatives what had just happened. The next  morning Astrid woke up and prepared to go claim her prize money, but suddenly  realized that she could not remember where she had placed her ticket. Given that her  memory was no longer as sharp as it used to be, she searched and searched around  her messy house for hours to no avail. She had absolutely no recollection of where  she might have stored or dropped the ticket.
 Astrid had been given thirty days to claim her prize, or else it would be canceled.
 For 27 days, her schedule was dedicated to searching every surface and square foot  of her house for the missing ticket. With only three days left, she decided to finally  call her daughters for help. She had been too embarrassed to call them from the  beginning because her house was so messy, but now had no other choice. Figuring  that helping their mother find the ticket would probably secure at least an extra  million dollars to them, all three of Astrid's daughters immediately sped over to her  house.
 Within the first half hour of searching, the youngest of her daughters hollered, "I  found it!" It turned out Astrid had left it in a dish cabinet. "Oh, thank you, daughter!"  Astrid cried. "I owe you so much!" Her daughter's smile glistened with pride as her  two sisters scowled at her from the next room.

122. A NEW "ALARM CLOCK"
 For most people, an ideal morning might consist of waking up to the warm sun  creeping in through the bedroom window, along with the cheerful chirping of the  birds from a nearby tree. Sadly, this is not the case for Michael, a part-time student  that works late nights as a warehouse manager. Michael gets home around 2:00 a.m.
 every night, and heads straight to bed to get as much sleep as possible until his  classes start at 10:00 a.m. However, for the past week, Michael has had a new  "alarm clock" that he unfortunately has no control of. It is an energetic, loud,  mockingbird that has decided to make the tree outside of Michael's window his new  home.
 Each morning, the bird begins singing as loud as possible at exactly 5:55 a.m.
 and does not stop until late into the night. Most city birds begin the day with sweet,  gentle chirps that can barely even be heard indoors, but the sounds of mockingbirds  are very distinct and consist of various noises that the mockingbird hears and then  imitates. This can include chirps from other birds, or even car alarms and school  bells.
 After one week of losing sleep as a result of the bird noises, Michael decided to do  something. "Go away!" he screamed out his window. When that didn't work, he  started throwing things at the tree to try to scare the bird away. This only made the  bird get even louder! As a final resort, Michael phoned his local Animal Control, and  requested to get someone to remove the bird from the area. "We can't do that,"  replied the Animal Control Specialist. "Mockingbirds are a valued feature of North  America's wildlife and are protected by many laws. You should consider yourself lucky  to have one so close to home. Just enjoy the beautiful sounds of nature."  Furious, Michael hung up the phone, and threw himself on the couch, dozing off  into the deepest sleep he had ever experienced all week. Only five minutes later he  awoke to a thunderous "caw-caw!" coming from outside.

123. THE UNLIKELY REUNION
 On December 26, 2004, a 10-minute long earthquake with a 9.3 magnitude  occurred in the Indian Ocean. This massive earthquake, which is the third strongest  ever recorded in history, triggered various powerful tsunamis that reached over a  dozen countries' shores. Nearly 230,000 people were killed by the catastrophe, and  hundreds of thousands of others ended up injured or missing. In the midst of all the  devastation caused by this disaster, many amazing and inspiring survival stories have  emerged. One of the most extraordinary of these is the story of a young girl named  Wati.
 The tsunami struck her hometown of Aceh when she was only eight years old.
 Like so many others, the powerful waves separated her from her family, and she  ended up being washed into an unknown town. After many years of searching for her,  her family gave up and assumed she had died after being swept away. Miraculously,  Wati was returned to her parents seven years later, at the age of 15!
 According to Wati, she had been "adopted" by a stranger who found her on the  streets after the tsunami. Although the woman took her in to live with her, she forced  Wati to beg on the streets and would often beat her if she did not make enough  money. The girl had tried to find her family by asking for help from strangers, but did  not remember the names of her parents and could only vaguely remember that she  had a grandfather named Ibraham.
 Finally one day, a cab driver who heard Wati's story happened to know an old man  with that name in a nearby town and decided to take her to him. Although the old  man did not recognize her at first, he took Wati to see his daughter. "When I saw my  mother, I knew it was her," said the 15-year-old. "I just knew." The parents were able  to confirm that it really was their daughter based on a scar and birthmark on the  girl's hip. This miraculous story is unfortunately one of the only confirmed reunions  among families that were separated by the disaster.

124. THRIFT STORE TREASURES
 It was Saturday morning. Mary walked out of her house with twenty dollars in her  pocket and a spirit full of optimism. She had spent the previous night in front of her  television set watching a reality show that followed lucky people who had found  amazing things at their local thrift shops. All of these people had bought seemingly  ordinary items for extremely low prices, and ended up discovering that their items  were actually very valuable treasures. After having spent five consecutive hours  watching other people's experiences, Mary was determined to give bargain hunting a  try in hopes of finding something that would make her rich.
 One of her favorite stories from the show was of a man who had purchased a  copy of the Declaration of Independence thinking that it was a cheap replica, for only  $2. He ended up discovering that the print was actually one of only 200 official copies  of the Declaration of Independence commissioned by John Quincy Adams in 1820.
 The man ended up making $477,650 after selling it.
 As Mary walked into her local thrift shop, she tried recalling what all the people in  the reality show had looked for. The most common items that people got rich from  were paintings and so she headed straight to the Home Decorations aisle. Once  there, she couldn't decide which looked most expensive. They actually all seemed  pretty ugly to her. "Excuse me," Mary said to an elderly woman walking by. "Which  painting do you think could make me richer?" Confused, the old lady quickly pointed  at one and walked away.
 The painting the old lady had pointed at was of a cat collage with almost 20  different cat faces jumbled atop of one another. "Definitely not my first choice,"  thought Mary. However, she trusted destiny's decision and bought the painting for  five dollars. After putting it up online, she began receiving dozens of emails asking if  the picture frame displayed came with the painting. In order to see what all the buzz  about the frame was about, she took it to an antique store and asked if there was  anything special about the frame. "Of course, it is special!" remarked the clerk at the  store. "Its wood and age make it at least $25,000!" Mary ended up selling the frame  for $30,000. A few days later, the buyer returned the ugly painting to her through the  mail.

125. WINTER TIME
 Winter was approaching. Jason was excited for the coming season. It was his  favorite time of a year. He loved the cold weather and snow. Jason lived in New York.
 During winter it would snow in New York. He always played in the snow, even as an  adult. Jason would gather his family and friends at the park, where they had snowball  fights. It was a lot of fun.
 His favorite holiday Christmas occurred in winter. This was another reason why  winter was Jason's favorite season. Every year, he bought presents for his friends and  family. Jason loved seeing the look on their faces when they unwrapped their  Christmas presents. It was better to give than to receive, Jason thought. Jason loved  everything about Christmas. He enjoyed caroling. He loved singing Christmas music.
 He loved kissing his wife under the mistletoe. He loved drinking sweet eggnog. Jason  sometimes even dressed up as Santa Claus for fun, and entertained his nephews.
 Winter also came at the end of a year. New Year's Day would come after  Christmas. Jason also loved this holiday. It was a day to celebrate the new year to  come, while reflecting on the past one. Jason always made New Year's resolutions.
 Every year he made a new resolution. This year he promised to go skydiving. Last  year, he promised himself to lose twenty pounds. Jason always kept his New Year's  resolution. He lost twenty pounds in three months. This year was no exception. He  planned to sign up for skydiving lessons in January of next year.
 Jason could not stop thinking about winter. He could not wait for it to come. It  was going to be the best winter yet. Jason needed to wait five more months because  it was barely mid July.

126. NO SMOKING
 For the past week Elizabeth would come home from work and discover that her  apartment smelled like cigarette smoke. She did not know where the smell was  coming from. Elizabeth didn't smoke. No one else had the key to her apartment to  smoke inside while she was at work. The smell of smoke especially bothered her  because she had asthma.
 One day Elizabeth stayed home from work because she was expecting a package.
 When she woke up that morning, the apartment smelled fine. At one in the  afternoon, Elizabeth went into the kitchen to make a sandwich for lunch. That was  when she noticed the smell of cigarette smoke. She called the building's  superintendent. By the time he arrived at Elizabeth's apartment, the whole place  smelled like cigarette smoke. The super told Elizabeth he was pretty sure the smoke  was coming up though the vents from her new downstairs neighbor. The new  neighbor was a smoker. The super told Elizabeth there was nothing to be done. The  building was really old and the vents couldn't be sealed. It was also perfectly legal for  the downstairs neighbor to smoke in his apartment. He suggested that Elizabeth buy  an air filter and see if that would help.
 Elizabeth bought an air filter but didn't find it to be enough. Her asthma was  getting worse. Her clothes and furniture were beginning to smell like cigarette smoke,  too. Elizabeth decided to go downstairs to talk to the neighbor. She was going to ask  him not to smoke in his apartment. Elizabeth knocked on the door. When he opened  the door, a huge wave of cigarette smoke came out. Elizabeth began coughing  violently. The neighbor gave Elizabeth a disgusted look. "Are you trying to get me  sick?" the neighbor asked her. Elizabeth couldn't believe what he was saying. "No, but  you are," she said.

127. COMPOSTING
 Ron was excited to show his wife Debbie what he had bought at the home  improvement store. Debbie, however, was not impressed when she saw the big, black  plastic bin. She thought it was a garbage can. "We have a garbage can already. Why  did you get another one?" Debbie asked. She seemed annoyed.
 Ron explained that it was not a garbage can. It was a compost bin. Ron explained  that a compost bin was a place where they could put any organic waste, like fallen  leaves, grass clippings, and fruit and vegetable peels. "Why can't we just throw that  in the trash?" Debbie asked. She really didn't want extra work for herself. Ron  explained that it was good for the environment. About 30% of all the garbage in the  United States is made up of waste from food and yards. Not only would they produce  less garbage, they would also make compost, which was rich soil. It would help  Debbie's flowers. She could have the beautiful garden she always dreamed of. Ron  explained that little by little inside the bin, the food scraps and green waste would  create a pile. The pile would naturally break down.
 "Where are we keeping this pile?" Debbie asked. Ron said the bin would go in the  back yard. Debbie wasn't convinced. She was worried about rats and roaches. Ron  explained that as long as they didn't put any meat scraps or oily items in the compost  bin, then rats wouldn't be a problem. Roaches, however, were a natural part of the  materials breaking down.
 Ron was especially excited about what he bought to put in the compost bin. He  pulled out a small box and gave it to Debbie. She opened it and screamed before  dropping the box on the floor. The box was filled with worms.

128. GIVING A HAND
 Jaime, a new immigrant, was attending his daughter's first performance in a  school play. His daughter, Carol, was five years old. She was a kindergarten student  at the local public school. Carol did not have a very big role in the school play. She  was playing a rain cloud in a play about the drought in California. Carol had one line.
 Her line was, "I am sad enough to cry about how dry the state is."  Jaime and his wife made sure to arrive early so that they could get a good seat in  the auditorium. They secured seats in the front row. Before the show began, the  school principal made an introductory speech. The speech was about how hard the  students and teachers worked together to make the play possible. At the end of the  speech, the principal said, "Let's give the school staff a hand".
 Jaime, whose English was not very good, stood up when the principal said this. He  knew that when people said "to give someone a hand" they meant they needed help.
 Jaime always wanted to help, especially at his daughter's school. Jaime thought  maybe they needed help backstage.
 Jaime's wife put her arm in front of her husband. "Where are you going?" she  whispered. "They need a hand," Jaime whispered back. His wife explained that "to  give someone a hand" could also mean to applaud someone. "They don't need help.
 They just want us to clap," Jaime's wife said. Jaime felt a little embarrassed. He sat  back down and began clapping along with the rest of the audience.
 Jaime thought to himself that someone needed to give the English language a  hand. How could one phrase mean two different things? He meant the English  language needed help.

129. ARRESTED TWICE IN ONE DAY
 Donald had a rough morning. He had an argument with his wife, so he thought it  would be a good idea to finish a six-pack of beer and a handful of prescription pain  pills. This would have been fine if he had stayed inside his house. Instead, drunk and  high, Donald began to harass his next-door neighbor. First he banged on his  neighbor's door. Then he broke the glass panel of a porch light. Finally he ripped the  light's wires out of the wall. That was the last straw. The neighbor called the police.
 The police came and arrested Donald for public intoxication and disturbing the peace.
 Donald was taken to a nearby jail. His stay only lasted a few hours. As soon as he  was more sober, the police released him. Apparently, Donald wasn't quite sober  enough though.
 When he was released, Donald realized he was pretty far from his home. He didn't  feel like walking almost two miles, so he called his friend from the jail to come get  him. But Donald was getting impatient. When a woman got out of her car in the  parking lot, he tried to get in. The woman screamed for help. Donald screamed, "But  this is my car!" The woman kept screaming and Donald got out. He then thought it  would be a good idea to take the bus home. A deputy was watching and arrested  Donald again, after he had only been free for one hour. This time, however, Donald's  jail stay would not be as short. He was charged with attempted burglary. A judge set  his bail at $10,000. He didn't have $10,000, so he is still in jail awaiting trial.

130. WHAT'S GOOD FOR THE GOOSE
 Rob Hernandez thought the fuzzy little chick at the pet shop was the cutest thing  he had ever seen. He had to buy it. He thought he was buying a baby duck, and  named his new pet Chaco. Chaco was loved and grew fast. Rob began to notice,  however, that Chaco was growing too fast and getting too big. When Chaco made his  first sound, Rob couldn't believe his ears. Rob expected a quack, but Chaco honked.
 Chaco was no duck. Chaco was a goose.
 Rob didn't reject Chaco though. He kept him as long as he could. Chaco was not a  quiet goose. He made a lot of noise, honking day and night. Rob's neighbors started  to complain. Rob didn't want to give Chaco up, but he couldn't risk his neighbors  calling the police on him either. Rob had to make a decision.
 Rob decided to take Chaco to a nearby park that had a lake with other geese. Rob  felt sad leaving Chaco and he was pretty sure his feathered friend felt sad, too. Rob  goes twice a week to the park to visit Chaco so that both the goose and the owner  are less sad. When Rob goes to visit, Chaco swims across the lake right into Rob's  arms. Sometimes, Chaco will even give Rob a little peck, a goose's way of giving a  kiss.
 When Rob goes to visit, he always brings snacks for Chaco. The other geese  seemed to be jealous of all the attention Chaco was getting, so now Rob brings  enough bread for all the geese to share. Rob and Chaco also play. Rob throws his  former pet into the lake. Chaco goes underwater, swims a little, and then returns to  the shore so that Rob can throw him in again.

131. NO SUCH THING AS FREE LUNCH
 Ever since Mary moved to the United States one year ago, she often heard the  phrase "no such thing as free lunch". While she understood this to mean that you  can't get something for nothing, she heard other mothers at her child's school talking  about the free lunch program.
 "How much does it cost to enroll?" Mary asked the secretary at her child's school.
 The secretary smiled and told Mary that it didn't cost anything except a little bit of  time. In order to find out if Mary's child was qualified to get free lunch at school, she  had to fill out a form. The form was available in many languages besides English. It  asked Mary basic questions like where she lived, how many children she had, and  what her annual income was.
 Filling out the form was easy, and Mary didn't have to include proof of her income.
 She was worried though if the information on the form would be shared with other  agencies. The secretary told her that the information was not shared. If Mary made  below a certain amount annually, her child could get free lunch not just during the  school year, but also even during the summer, when there was no school.
 Mary knew this would help her family. While Mary did work, she only worked part time. Giving her child money for lunch every day did add up and impact the family  budget.
 After filling out and submitting the form back to the school secretary, Mary had to  wait a month or two before finding out if she was qualified. A few weeks after she  submitted the form, a letter arrived in the mail. The letter informed her that her child  was qualified. The letter also told her that her child could also get free breakfast in  school.

132. PAYING TO WIN
 Tom noticed that every morning when he went to school, his mother would give  him a letter to drop in the mailbox on the corner. "Who are you writing to so much?"  he asked. "I'm just trying my luck," Tom's mother told him.
 A few weeks after Tom started mailing out the letters, he noticed that his mother  was getting a lot more mail. Some of the mail advertised on the envelope that she  might already be a winner. His mother was also getting many more magazines. Some  of the magazines were about things his mother didn't eve care about, like cats.
 "Mom, why are you getting so many magazines?" Tom asked her. She told him  that she had been entering contests and that part of the process included subscribing  to magazines. "It will increase my chances of winning the jackpot," she told him.
 Soon the family mailbox was filled with more contests announcements, magazines,  and bills.
 Tom's mother was surprised. She didn't think that checking off the boxes of  magazines that looked interesting and affixing stickers to the return forms would cost  her. She was spending more and more money and hadn't won anything. She wanted  to be like the people in the commercials she saw on television. People bringing  balloons and oversized checks surprised those people who entered the contests. Tom  read the fine print. The magazines weren't free and Tom's mother was not increasing  her chances of winning anything by subscribing. Tom did some research and found  out there had even been lawsuits against the companies running the contests and  selling the magazine subscriptions.
 Tom's mother felt bad. "It pays to win, mom, but you can't pay to win," Tom told  her. Tom's mother wondered what she was going to do with all these magazines.

133. A NIGHT IN LAS VEGAS
 Nancy Scott just turned 21 last October. She was excited about finally being able  to go to concerts that were strictly 21 and over. She decided that she would go to Las  Vegas for her first concert. Jennifer, Nancy's sister, decided to go along with her  because she didn't want her sister to go alone and get lost. Jennifer called her friends  Matt and Jake, and they all decided to make the drive to Las Vegas.
 As they arrived in Las Vegas, they parked their car in the parking lot of the hotel  they were staying in. Nancy took a shower, and then Jennifer took one. They got  dressed and then met both Matt and Jake in the lobby of the hotel. Nancy was so  excited; she asked her sister if she wanted to get a drink. Jennifer agreed and said  "OK, but only one." Jennifer bought her sister a giant drink that came in a four-foot  tall cup, and she got the same. Nancy couldn't believe how big the drink was. "It's  almost as tall as me," Nancy said. Jennifer laughed and took a drink from her cup.
 Matt and Jake arrived first at the place where the concert was going to be. They  called the sisters, and told them where to meet them. Nancy was excited to see the  concert, because one of her favorite bands was playing. As they got in line to get in,  Jennifer went to the restroom. When Jennifer was getting back to her friends and  sister, she met one of the members of the band named Jill. Jennifer told Jill about  Nancy coming all the way to Las Vegas to see this show, and if she could do  something special for her. Jill smiled and said sure. She reached into her purse and  gave Jennifer four backstage passes. Jennifer hugged Jill and said thank you. Jennifer  ran back to Nancy, and told her to close her eyes. When Jennifer told Nancy to open  her eyes, she was holding up the backstage passes in front of Nancy. Nancy began  jumping up and down with joy.

134. THE GIRL NEXT DOOR
 James Baker was only 12 years old when his parents decided to move the family  to a new town. At first James was heartbroken, because he had to leave his friends  behind. His mother told James that it would be okay, and that he would make new  friends.
 When James and his family finally arrived at their new home, they decided to go  out to meet the neighbors. It was a typical American suburban neighborhood. Every  house had a big lawn in the front with a walkway leading up to the door. James felt  uncomfortable, and he didn't want to meet the neighbors. The first house they went  to belonged to an elderly couple. They seemed nice, but they didn't have any kids  that were James's age. The next house they visited had bicycles parked by the  garage door, so James thought kids of his age might live there. James knocked on the  door, and a young girl named Linda answered. James became nervous, and he let his  mother do the talking. Linda's parents weren't home, but she told James's mother  that they would go visit when they got home. Linda smiled at James, said goodbye,  and closed the door.
 As they were walking back to their house next door, James looked back and  noticed Linda was looking at him through the window. James looked at her, and Linda  smiled. When they got home, James went to his new room. He took a look outside  his window, and noticed that he could see Linda in her room. He couldn't help looking  at her. He thought she was the prettiest girl he had ever seen. As James was looking  at her, he heard his mother calling. "I'll go downstairs in a moment, mom," James  said as he turned away from the window. When James looked back to Linda, she was  staring right at him. James fell down to the floor, and said in a whisper "Oh, no. I  hope she didn't see me. Oh, please. Please." Linda saw him, and laughed. She  thought James was cute.

135. MY BEST FRIEND
 My best friend's name is Joseph Taylor, but he prefers to be called Joe. He does a  lot of stupid stuff, and it usually gets him in trouble. The other day, while he was  trying to impress some girls, he fell off his skateboard and broke his arm. Joe had to  get his arm in a cast, but he told me it was worth it. He had already gotten three  phone numbers from the girls he was trying to impress.
 I always love Joe coming over to my house, because it makes my day more  exciting. After he showed me his arm, Joe asked me if I wanted to go to the mall.
 "Sure, why not?" I said. I asked my mom for permission, and she said yes.
 When we got to the mall, Joe wanted to get something to eat, so we went to  McDonald's. We got two hamburgers and two sodas, and then we went walking  around the mall. For some reason, Joe always liked stealing things from the stores at  the mall. I never understood why he stole the things he did. For example, that day he  stole three key chains, five pairs of socks, and a t-shirt of a television show that he  had never heard of. Joe always said the same thing when he got out of the store, "I  love the rush of stealing!" I always looked at him, shook my head, and called him an  idiot.
 The worst was yet to come. When we were leaving the mall to go catch the bus, a  security guard grabbed Joe and me by the shoulders and told us we couldn't leave.
 The security guard took us to his office, and called our parents. I was worried  because I knew my dad would yell at me. Joe, on the other hand, was laughing and  was telling me jokes. When our parents showed up to pick us up, Joe looked at me,  smiling, and said, "See you in a couple of months." I looked at him, shook my head,  and called him an idiot.

136. A DAY IN THE PARK
 Michael Hall always loved playing basketball with his brother Scott. They lived  next to a park, and they went to play basketball at the park every day. Michael was a  junior at his college, and Scott was a freshman. They both tried out for the college  team, but were so nervous during the tryouts that they didn't make it. One day, while  they were playing basketball, Michael noticed that a guy was watching them play.
 When Michael and Scott finished playing, the guy who was watching them went up to  Michael.
 "You guys have some skills," the guy said. Michael finally realized who the man  was. It was Charles King, a famous basketball player. Charles told them that he used  to play basketball at that park too when he was younger. Charles asked them if they  played for school, or if they had a team with friends. They said they didn't make it  into their school's team. "I never made it into my school's basketball team either,"  Charles said.
 Charles asked the brothers if they wanted to play a game of 2 on 1, they happily  said yes. Charles won, of course, but he told the brothers that they were really good.
 Charles then told the brothers that he was starting a basketball camp at his old high  school, and if they were interested; they could join it for free. The brothers had heard  about it, and said that they would love to join. "We just have to ask our mother,"  Scott said. Charles laughed, and said, "Of course, you don't want to get mom mad."  The two brothers ran back home, and they told their mom about what had happened  at the park. She told them that they could join as long as they kept up with their  homework and their classes. The brothers agreed, and went back to the park to  practice.

137. GOING OUT TO THE MOVIES
 Robert Lee and his brothers were excited about the new "Godzilla" movie that was  coming out. The day the movie came out, Robert and his brothers went to the theater  early. Robert's brothers wanted to see another movie first, and then they wanted to  sneak into "Godzilla." Robert didn't mind, because he liked going to the movies.
 When they got to the theater, Robert bought his brothers popcorn, soda, and some  candy. When they got everything, they went to find their seats.
 Robert's brothers didn't really like the first movie they watched, but they were  excited to see "Godzilla." When they got out of the first movie, Robert went to get  more soda and popcorn, because his brothers had finished all of it. Robert's brothers  snuck into the theater, and they were waiting for Robert to come back with the  snacks. When Robert tried to go back in to see "Godzilla", a security guard asked him  for his ticket. Robert didn't have one for "Godzilla," so the security guard had to kick  him out.
 Robert had to go outside and buy another ticket for "Godzilla." He felt  embarrassed, because he had to stand in the line with the popcorn and soda. The  people in line and the people who worked in the ticket booth looked at Robert and  found him funny. Robert knew that they were looking at him, because they knew he  got kicked out for trying to sneak into another movie. His face turned red. He thought  about calling his brothers to get out, so that they could go home. Robert thought  about how his brothers wanted to see the movie too, and so he bought the ticket and  went back in. The security guard looked at him again, and asked him for his ticket.
 Robert showed it to him, and went into the theater. The security guard laughed.

138. WATER BALLOON WAR
 It was a hot day in Clarksville. The children in the neighborhood were sweating,  and wanted to do something refreshing. The pool was closed because they were  building something new in it. They thought about what they could do to escape the  heat, but they never could agree on doing the same thing. That's when Christopher  Baker decided to go to the store. He bought 10 bags of balloons, and went to his  house to fill them up with water. He invited his two best friends Joseph and Patrick to  help him out. By the time they finished, they had five buckets of water balloons.
 They went outside with the buckets, put them in the center of Joseph's lawn, and  started throwing them to the children in the neighborhood. At first, the other children  were surprised, but then they wanted to get wetter. They all went to the store and  bought some balloons for themselves. Christopher and his friends went back into the  house to make more balloons. When they get back outside, they got attacked with 10  different water balloons.
 Christopher and his friends started laughing when they realized where the other  boys were. They decided to hide. Christopher gave the orders to his friends. He told  Joseph to hide behind his dad's car; he told Patrick to hide behind his mom's car.
 They each took four water balloons with them. Christopher told them to wait for his  signal, and then they could throw the balloons.
 Christopher knew where three of the boys were hiding, so he went running and  attacked them with five water balloons. Christopher then ran back to the place where  he was hiding, but the boys were coming after him. Christopher yelled out, "Now!"  Joseph and Patrick came out of hiding and attacked the boys with their water  balloons. The boys went back. Christopher and his friends started laughing.

He wanted to sleep late, he wanted to play video games, and he wanted to  spend time with his friends. David's dad decided that he would get a job for David.
 When he came home, he handed David a uniform for the Burger Hut. David was sad  because he didn't want to work at the Burger Hut. He knew all of his friends went  there, and he knew that his friends would make fun of him. David knew that his dad  was able to get him this job because the owner was his dad's friend. The owner's  name is Michael. David didn't really like him that much.
 David had the first day at work. Everyone that worked at the Burger Hut had to  wear a hat. David's hat fell into the oil where they made the fries. Michael had to get  it out with a big spoon. After a week had passed by, David seemed to be getting used  to working at the Burger Hut. Michael was impressed with how hard David worked,  and told him he could take a day off.
 During his day off, David went out with his friends. They went to the park and  played some basketball, and then his friends decided to go get something to eat.
 David asked them where they wanted to go. They said they wanted to go eat at the  Burger Hut. David tried to convince them to go somewhere else, but his friends really  wanted to go to the Burger Hut.
 When they got to the Burger Hut, David put on his sweater and his hat. He sat  down in the far corner of the restaurant, and tried to hide himself from his co workers and his boss. When his friends got their food, they went to sit down with  David. Michael came out and saw David. He went up to him and said, "You just can't  get enough of this place, huh, David?" Michael chuckled and then left. David's friends  took a bite out of their burgers, and looked at David. "You work here?" One of David's  friend asked. His another friend looked at him and said, "Can you get me a job?"  David smiled and nervously said, "I'll try."

141. THE LAST DRINK
 Karen and Betty Robinson were out celebrating their birthdays. They were  identical twins, and had just turned 30. They went out to a baseball game with a  couple of friends. They all bought themselves beer, and each drank eight beers.
 Karen couldn't drink as much as Betty could, so she had gotten drunk by the fifth  beer. Karen and Betty knew that they were going to be drinking, so they decided to  take the bus to the game. Their friends all came on the bus as well.
 When it was time to go home, Karen and Betty got back on the bus with their  friends. They got to Union Station, and got off to catch their train home. They said  bye to their friends, and went to catch the train. People looked at them weird,  because they could tell that they were drunk. When they were on the train, Karen  began to feel sick. Betty looked at her, and started to laugh. Karen started to vomit,  but she stopped herself. She got out of the train, and went running to the bathroom  to finish vomiting.
 When they got home, Betty told Karen to drink another beer to calm her stomach.
 Karen agreed and drank it. It calmed her down, and then she fell asleep. The next  day, Karen and Betty woke up sick. They couldn't believe how drunk they had gotten.
 They both felt terrible. Their stomachs hurt; their heads hurt; they both felt dizzy.
 When Betty got to work, she found a closet and fell asleep. When Karen got to work,  she went to the restroom and threw up. When they both got out of work, they  promised themselves that they wouldn't drink like that ever again.

142. CHRISTOPHER THE REPORTER
 When Christopher Lee was a young man, he had a dream to become an English  professor. He worked hard at this by first going to a community college after high  school before transferring to the University of California, Los Angeles. At UCLA, Chris  earned his bachelor's degree in English, but he still needed his Master's degree to  teach at college. Chris met George while taking a class at his old community college.
 George was a news reporter, who told Chris how much he enjoyed his job. Chris  became very interested in his story.
 It turned out George was also an English major, but he turned to journalism  because he wanted to be published. George said to Chris one day, "Chris, I've known  lots of English majors who want to be published, but never got that chance. In  journalism, you can get published, and get published often." Chris thought about his  words and asked him how he became a journalist. George laughed and said, "Start  with Journalism 101."  Chris took his advice, and soon he fell in love with writing in journalism style. Its  short, precise method of writing appealed to Chris. Journalists deal only in facts. It is  not like English writing. You don't paint pictures in journalism; you report facts. There  is a measure of creativity involved with writing in a journalistic style, but it is unlike  English.
 Soon, Chris earned his certificate, and went on to earn his Master's degree in  journalism. He now works for a large, daily newspaper. He is very grateful to his old  friend George, who introduced him to journalism. He has now been published more  than 200 times. George changed the course of Christopher's life.

143. RICHARD'S FATHER
 Richard grew up in Los Angeles, California, and had a pretty good life. There was  food on the table and he had plenty of clothes to wear. He didn't really have any  needs. He went to a good school in a nice area of the city, and had many friends.
 Richard grew up with three older sisters, who also enjoyed their life in California, and  had many friends. All this was possible because of their father Michael.
 Michael was born into poverty in a small town just outside of Mexico City. When  Michael was a boy, he remembered times when there was not enough food to eat, or  fresh water to drink. Whenever he was thirsty, he would go to the river to collect  water. Michael lived in a hut that had no floor. Many times he slept on the dirt, with  just a blanket between him and the ground.
 That all changed when, at the age of 17, Michael emigrated to the United States  with his family. The first few years were almost as difficult as it was in Mexico, but  gradually things began getting better for Michael and his family.
 When Michael turned 19, he decided to enroll into a community college. His father  had always stressed the importance of learning English while they lived in Mexico.
 That talent was very useful to Michael now. Soon Michael was bringing home  excellent report cards. Because of this, he was able to transfer to a university and  earned his degree in engineering.
 Michael got a great job that paid well, which allowed him to move into a better  part of town, and to help his parents, too. He soon had a family of his own. When  Richard was born, it was the happiest day in Michael's life.

144. THE BARTENDER
 As a bartender at one of Los Angeles's busiest clubs, Daniel King often saw a lot  of weird stuff. During the last party he worked, he saw five people throwing up on the  dance floor, two fights, and a girl losing her top in front of everyone. The weirdest  thing that ever happened to Daniel was when a drunken girl asked him to dance. He  denied at first, but when she came back for another drink, she dragged him to the  dance floor.
 Girls had dragged Daniel to the dance floor before, but this time was different.
 The girls that dragged him out before actually knew how to dance, but this girl did  not and was drunk. She kept jumping up and down. Shaking her body and looking at  Daniel straight in the eyes. She was so drunk that she kept bumping into the other  people that were dancing.
 As the music played, the girl kept jumping and dancing. She kept yelling to Daniel  that she had to go to the restroom, but he couldn't hear her. She yelled at Daniel  once more and that's when it happened. She had an accident on the dance floor.
 Some of her urine actually got on Daniel's shoes. After it happened, the girl was so  embarrassed that she ran out of the club crying. Daniel couldn't believe what had  happened. He told people to move out of the way, while his friend came over to clean  up the dance floor.
 The weird thing about that incident was that the girl came back the next day  looking for her cell phone, but she didn't remember Daniel. Daniel wanted to go hide,  because he thought she would recognize him, but she didn't. Daniel decided that he  would never go out to dance with another girl while he was working.

145. A TRIP TO HAWAII
 "You're a Winner!" That's what Helen Green read as she opened an envelope she  got in the mail. She couldn't believe it. She had won. Helen's husband Roger came  over to see why Helen was screaming and jumping. Helen told Roger "You're not  going to believe it. Your sister entered us in a sweepstakes for a Hawaii vacation, and  we won. We won, Roger!" Roger didn't believe it at first, but then he researched it.
 "Well, I guess we're going to Hawaii, honey," he told Helen. They both started  jumping with joy.
 Helen and Roger arrived at Hawaii, and couldn't believe how beautiful everything  looked. They had been married for 20 years, but had never had a vacation. After they  had checked into their hotel room, they decided to go to the beach. They met a  surfer named William, although he liked to be called Will, who was offering free  lessons. Seeing that Roger had always wanted to learn how to surf, they decided to  go. Will explained to Roger how to paddle the surf board, and he taught him how to  stand up on it. After two hours of training in the sand, Will told Roger that they would  go out to the water. Roger didn't like that.
 "Where are we going?" Roger nervously asked. "Over there," said Will, as he  pointed to the ocean. He started getting nervous, and started breathing heavy. Helen  went over to Roger and calmed him down. "They're probably in their honeymoon,"  people said as they passed Roger and Helen. Roger laughed. He finally calmed down.
 He went out to the ocean with Will, and tried to surf. Every time he tried to get on  the surf board he ended up falling. When they got back to the land, Helen hugged  Roger and kissed him. "You did great, honey. I love you," Helen said. Roger knew she  was lying, but he had never seen Helen smile so greatly. He let it go.

146. FAMILY REUNION
 Paul Martin didn't like going to his family reunion. He didn't know most of them,  and he didn't even like the people he did know. Paul had always been a loner. He  liked doing things alone; he went to the movies alone; he went to concerts alone; he  liked to go eat alone. So, at the family reunion, it was no surprise to see that Paul  was sitting alone at a table where no one was sitting at. Occasionally, an aunt or  uncle of his would come up to say hello, but none of his cousins ever said hello to  him. Paul was fine with it; he didn't care, because he didn't like talking to them,  either.
 During his last family reunion, Paul decided to play a trick on his cousins. His  cousins had been playing Nintendo in his uncle's room. Paul knew how to turn off all  the power in the house. He locked the door to his uncle's room, and then went to  turn off the power. When all the lights turned off, he could hear his cousins begin to  yell. They were upset because the game was going really well.
 When his cousins tried to leave, they realized that the door was locked. They  began to yell for help, and Paul started laughing. All of his aunts and uncles were  outside enjoying the party, so no one could hear the yells. Paul went back outside  and sat down at a table. He was still laughing. An hour passed, and his aunt started  looking for her son. When Paul's cousins were finally set free from the room, they  started looking for Paul, because they knew he had locked them in there. Paul wasn't  worried; he knew they wouldn't do anything. He looked at them, laughed, and then  went back to listen to music. The cousins sat down, and got something to eat. They  were all mad at Paul.

147. LOSING MY DOG
 It was Sunday, the last time I saw my dog. His name is Spot, because his whole  body is covered with spots. He is a good dog. He never bites, and almost never  barks. I got Spot when I was around 9 years old. All of my friends knew that Spot  was like my best friend. So, when I told everyone that Spot had gotten lost, they all  came out trying to help out. We looked for hours.
 My dad told me that maybe Spot got picked up by a dog catcher. If that was true,  then he would be at the dog pound, which is where they send all the dogs that get  lost. My friend Mark told me that they put pictures of all the dogs they find in the  street online, so I went online to try. I spent more than an hour checking the online  pictures of the dogs, and finally found my Spot. I started jumping with joy.
 I went with my mom and dad to pick up Spot. When we got there, he started  barking and running in circles all around his cage. I knew he was happy to see us. He  had been lost for about two weeks. When we got him home, he ran around the  backyard and ran directly into his little house my dad and I built for him. He started  barking really loudly, which is weird for Spot. As soon as my sister heard Spot, she  came running out to try and catch him. He ran around her and then let himself be  captured. I think he just wanted to be petted. I knew he was happy to be back home  and even happier when I brought out his food. I hope Spot never gets lost again.

148. A BIG CITY AND A SMALL TOWN
 Edward Allen always hated living in Los Angeles. Everything was too expensive;  traffic was always bad; people were not friendly; it was always crowded. Edward  never wanted to live in a big city. He always wanted to live somewhere in the country,  in a small town, where everyone knew everyone. It was a dream that he was  dedicated to achieving.
 The day after his 26th birthday, he called his friend Lisa, who had moved to a  small town in Iowa. He asked her how it was like over there. She told him that he  would love it. It's quiet and peaceful; people are friendly. Edward made up his mind;  he was going to move to this little town. He sat down with his mom and dad, and told  them what he was planning on doing. They supported his decision and helped him  pack his things. He would leave in a week.
 Lisa had helped Edward get a job where she worked, and she told Edward he  could stay with her and her roommate until he got back on his feet. Edward was  grateful. When he showed up, he immediately started working. He liked his job, but  he found it a bit boring at times. He was a waiter at a cafe. He liked the pie at the  restaurant, so it wasn't all bad.
 After he had been working for two months, he told Lisa that he couldn't handle it  anymore. He wanted to go back to the city. Lisa laughed and said, "You have always  hated the city, but now you're running back to it? I don't get you, Edward." Edward  didn't think living in a small town would be so boring. "The boredom alone will drive  me insane, Lisa," Edward said as he started packing his things.

149. LOOKING FOR A JOB
 Donald Turner wanted to get a job. He had graduated from his university with a  Bachelor's Degree in Business Administration. Since his graduation, he had applied  for 20 jobs, yet no one had called him back. Donald decided to be an accountant two  years ago, because he figured that it would be an easier way to earn money.
 Although Donald had studied to become an accountant, his real passion was painting.
 Donald took some art classes at his university. His teacher told him that he had  the talent, but needed to commit more to his painting. Even though Donald was  interested, he decided to play it safe and focus his study on becoming an accountant.
 He passed his art classes as well as his business classes, all with As. He was proud of  his grades. However, two years had passed, Donald still could not find a job. He  began getting frustrated.
 In order to calm himself down, Donald began painting. He would go to apply for  jobs in the morning, and then come back home and paint. When Donald began  feeling really stressed out, he would go out to the park and paint there. One day,  when Donald was painting at the park, a man began watching him paint. Donald  didn't see the man the whole time he was there.
 When Donald finished the painting, the man went to talk to him. "You have some  real talent," the man said. Donald chuckled and said thanks. The man wanted to  know if Donald was selling the painting. Donald was surprised. He didn't think anyone  would want to buy his paintings. Donald said yes, and the man offered him $1,500  for the painting. Donald almost dropped the painting because he couldn't believe it.
 After Donald sold the painting, he bought art supplies with the money he received.
 He decided to forget about being an accountant. He had never felt so happy.

150. SUPERSTORE
 For the past month Mark King had been receiving flyers in the mail about a new  superstore that was opening up in his neighborhood. The flyers confused him. He had  never heard the term superstore before. Later on, he found out that a superstore is a  large retail store that sells a variety of products, usually at discount prices.
 Sometimes superstores are also called big box stores. Many times they are chain  stores owned by one company.
 The flyers all had different messages about the superstore opening. One set of  flyers invited him and others to apply for jobs at the store. The jobs paid well and  even offered some benefits. Mark thought this was a good thing since he knew many  people were looking for work. Another set of flyers included coupons to be used on  opening day. The store had many bargains for common items like paper towels, but  also for big screen televisions. Mark thought this too was a good thing. It seemed like  a good idea to be able to get a variety of things in one place instead of going from  one store to another. It would save time and money. Superstores could sell groceries  and clothes under one roof.
 Another set of flyers contradicted the positive messages about the superstore  though. Some local residents were organizing a protest of the superstore. The flyers  said that the superstore was bad for the community because it threatened the  business of smaller stores in the area. Mark thought about Mr. Hernandez who owned  a small grocery store down the block. That was where Mark bought staple food items  like eggs and milk. He didn't want Mr. Hernandez's store to be closed, but he also  wanted to save money.

151. GETTING MY LICENSE
 Getting a driving license is very important for a 16-year-old. Today was my 16th  birthday, and my dad promised to take me to the Department of Motor Vehicles to do  my driving test. I passed my written test already, so it was for a road test today.
 When we got to DMV, I began to get really nervous. I was driving my dad's car, and I  didn't want to mess up and crash. My dad looked at me and told me that everything  would be fine.
 I had stayed up all night thinking about how it would go and if I would pass the  test. When the driver instructor came out, he told me to get in the car and turn on  the lights. I did as I was told. He then told me to turn on the left turn signal, and  then the right turn signal. They both worked, so it was time to start driving. The  instructor had dark sunglasses on, and he didn't say much when we got in the car.
 The instructor gave me directions to go straight and make a right turn at the next  stop sign, which was a couple of blocks away. I did as I was told, and then kept going  straight. Then the instructor told me to keep going straight until I reached a street  called Marengo and then to turn left. As I drove, I kept looking for Marengo Street,  and thought I might pass it and the instructor would deduct points from my test.
 When I finally found Marengo Street, I turned to tell the instructor. That was when  I realized that he was asleep. I couldn't believe it. This was an important event in my  life, an event that I had been worried about for months. When we finished, he woke  up and told me I had done a good job, and that I would be getting my license in  about a month. I laughed, and thanked him. I went to tell my dad the good news.

152. GOING TO DISNEYLAND
 Ruth Campbell had never gone to Disneyland as a child. She was now 40 years  old with two children, a boy and girl. The boy's name was Jeff and the girl's name  was Carol. When Jeff was 11 and Carol was 13, Ruth decided to take her kids to  Disneyland, which would be the first time any of them ever went. When they arrived  at Disneyland, Ruth explained to her children that if they got split up, they would  meet at the front of the park.
 The first thing Ruth did when they got inside was looking for Mickey Mouse. She  wanted to take pictures with all the characters at Disneyland. She even made a list of  the characters she wanted to take pictures with. Her children looked at her and  smiled. They saw that their mom was acting like a little girl again. She was giggling  every time she took a picture with a character.
 Her favorite Disney character was Donald Duck, so she kept an eye open for him.
 When they were in line for a ride, she saw that Donald was taking pictures with  people by a restaurant. She told her children: "Look, guys, it's Donald! Hopefully, he  is still there when we get out." When they got out of the ride, Donald wasn't there  anymore. Ruth told her children that it was okay, and that they would bump into him  later on.
 They enjoyed their day at Disneyland until it was time for the park to close. Ruth  and her children were looking at the fireworks that they put on every night at  Disneyland. She hugged her children and told them she loved them. They hugged her  back and continued to watch the show. When they were leaving the park, her  children noticed that Donald was taking photos with some other people, and their  mom hadn't noticed him yet. Carol told her mom that she needed to go to the  restroom, and asked her mom to wait for her for a moment. While she was waiting  for Carol to come back from the restroom, Ruth felt someone poke her on her  shoulder. It was Donald Duck with Carol! Ruth began tearing up a bit, and hugged  both of them. They all took photos with Donald Duck, the last character on Ruth's  list.

153. THE ARTIST, THE POOR MAN, AND THE MUSICIAN
 Three men once lived in a small town in Texas. One was a musician, another was  an artist, and the other was a poor homeless man. One day the artist was going to  start working on a new sculpture, but didn't have the necessary tools to start. He  went downtown and saw a poor homeless man. Because the artist was new in town  and got lost, he asked the homeless man where the nearest art supply store was.
 The homeless man told him that it was the red and white building around the corner.
 The artist looked at him and said thank you. He gave the homeless man a ten-dollar  bill with the words "pass it forward" written on the bill. The homeless man took the  money and said: "God bless you!"  A few hours had passed, and the homeless man started getting hungry. He walked  around in town, and saw a young musician playing outside a cafe. The homeless man  sat down and started listening to the music played by the musician. A waiter from the  cafe came out and told the homeless man that he had to leave, because he wasn't  buying anything, and other people wanted to sit down and enjoy the music. The  musician saw this and told the waiter to leave him alone and that he would like to  buy the homeless man something to eat. The waiter looked at the musician and said  okay. The homeless man thanked the musician. After he finished eating, he took out  the ten-dollar bill and gave it to the musician. The homeless man left.
 After the musician had finished playing at the cafe, he decided to go to a local art  festival with his girlfriend. As they were walking around and looking at all the  different paintings and sculptures, the musician's girlfriend saw a sculpture she liked.
 It was a young man helping out an older man who had fallen down. She wanted to  buy it, but didn't have enough money. The musician told her not to worry. He pulled  out ten dollars, and gave it to the artist. As the musician and his girlfriend walked  away, the artist looked at the ten-dollar bill, and smiled. "Well, look at that, you  found your way back home," said the artist.

154. THE EVILS OF TECHNOLOGY
 Maria Gonzalez didn't like how technology was slowly taking over everyone's life.
 She always took the bus to school. Whenever she got on the bus, she would notice  that more than half of the people were staring down at their phones. Fewer people  were having actual conversations with each other. She felt bad. She thought that this  was the reason why people had trouble relating to people in the real world. Everyone  was living online now.
 Maria had trouble making new friends because she hated being on social media  websites like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. She rarely met new people. She tried  going up to people on the bus and starting a conversation, but they always looked at  her weirdly. She felt like she was an outsider, and the only one that was not caught in  the Internet's web of lies.
 One day, while Maria was walking in the park, she saw a girl walking through the  park. The girl wore a long, colorful dress, and was always smiling. Maria wanted to  talk to this girl. She walked up to the girl and said hello. At first the girl was startled,  because she didn't see Maria coming, but then she smiled and said, "Hello. Do we  know each other?" Maria shook her head and said no. Maria asked her if she wanted  to hang out and talk. The girl said sure. Maria and the girl talked for hours. They  talked about everything: music, boys, family, food, and their shared distrust of  technology. Maria had done something she hadn't done since she was a young girl:  she made a new friend in the real world.

155. ANTHONY'S FIRST DAY AT DISNEYLAND
 Disneyland is also called Magic Kingdom. It is located in Anaheim, California. The  park opened in 1955, and was an instant success. When Anthony Martinez was a little  boy, his brothers and sisters told him about Disneyland. At first, Anthony didn't know  what they meant. He was just too young, and would call it "Dizzyland" as he couldn't  pronounce it properly. His father had taken his older siblings to the park many times,  but that was years ago. Anthony was much younger than his brothers and sisters.
 For a long time, Anthony kept asking his parents to take him to Disneyland, but  the feeling eventually wore off. He quit bugging his parents to take him. One day,  when Anthony was about 8 years old, a classmate came to school bragging about his  weekend at Disneyland. All of a sudden, Anthony wanted to go again. "Please,  mommy, take me to Disneyland," Anthony pleaded to his mom. His dad heard it, and  immediately told him "Okay, son, we're going this weekend for sure." Anthony's dad  hadn't realized that his youngest child had never been there, and felt very bad about  it.
 The weekend came, and Anthony was so excited. He couldn't keep still. When  they got into Disneyland, Anthony marveled at the castles and other attractions. He  especially liked the life-sized characters that roamed the park. He grew up watching  Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck. Now he was taking pictures with them. Anthony was  "in heaven."  The best part of the theme park is the rides. "Can we go on the Captain Nemo  Ride?" That question was soon followed by "Can we go on the Matterhorn?" Soon  Anthony had gone on just about every ride. He was overwhelmed by the place. Soon  the family was back in their SUV heading back home with Anthony fast asleep. It was  the greatest day of his young life. A day he would later call "the best day of my life."

156. WOKEN UP BY FIREWORKS
 A loud boom woke her up. She looked at the clock next to her bed. It was  midnight. "What was that?" she asked her husband, who hadn't been woken up by  the sound, so Betty shook him. Another loud boom followed. Then there was a  crackling sound. "Oh, that's just fireworks," Betty's husband said. It wasn't the fourth  of July, the most common day to hear fireworks. It was just a normal Thursday night  in the middle of June. "Why would there be fireworks now?" Betty asked.
 Betty and her husband just moved into a new house after their wedding. This was  the neighborhood her husband grew up in. He said it was common for people to start  setting off fireworks in the summer, even before the Independence Day holiday. "The  whole summer is a reason for fireworks here," Betty's husband told her. He said that  even when it wasn't summer, people set off fireworks for whatever they were  celebrating.
 "Maybe someone is having a graduation party or a birthday," Betty's husband told  her. He said that sometimes people set off fireworks even when a local sports team  won a game. Betty wondered how that was legal. She thought fireworks were illegal  to buy and use. Betty's husband told her that it was easy enough for people to buy  fireworks. He also told her that different counties in the state had different laws, so  people could buy fireworks in one county and use them in a different county, like  where they lived. "Also people can legally set off fireworks for holidays besides the  fourth of July, like for Lunar New Year," he added.
 Betty tried to go back to sleep, but the loud booms and crackles kept going. She  decided to get a glass of water and go out into the yard to see the fireworks.

157. COME OVER ANYTIME, BUT NOT REALLY
 Patricia was happy that she was finally making friends since moving to Los  Angeles from New York. She had left everything behind to move to be closer to her  boyfriend. The first friend she made was Helen. Helen worked with Patricia at a  clothing store in the local shopping mall. Sometimes Patricia would even see Helen on  the freeway when they were working the same shift. Patricia thought that they must  not live too far from one another. Helen confirmed this.
 "My neighborhood is right next to yours," Helen told Patricia while they were both  checking out customers. "Drop by anytime you want on a day when we're both not  working," Helen said. Patricia took the invitation too literally. She was able to get  Helen's address from their manager at work. "I want to surprise my new friend,"  Patricia told the manager. The manager thought that was sweet and without thinking  about Helen's privacy, he passed the address onto Patricia. On a day that Patricia and  Helen both had the day off, Patricia looked up Helen's address on her map application  on her cell phone. Helen's house was only 10 minutes away.
 Patricia followed the directions, and at 9:00 a.m., she rang the doorbell at 2374  Evergreen Avenue. It took Helen awhile to answer the door. She looked genuinely  surprised, but also confused when she saw Patricia on her doorstep. "What are you  doing here? How did you get my address?" Helen asked. She was still in her pajamas  and her hair was a mess. "You told me to drop by anytime we both had a day off, so I  got your address from our manager. I want to give you a surprise!" Patricia said. "I  was just being polite. You can't just show up at someone's house!" Helen said before  slamming the door on Patricia's face.

158. FINDING YOUR OWN APARTMENT
 Julie was tired of living with her parents. She was 22, and just finished college.
 She started a new job in an office, and didn't want her parents to tell her what to do  anymore, so Julie decided to start looking for an apartment. She started by looking at  classified ads in the newspaper and checking on websites like Craigslist.
 The first apartment she went to see sounded perfect on the newspaper. It was  advertised as a cozy one-bedroom apartment with a view. She made an appointment  to view the apartment. When the landlord opened the door, Julie was sorely  disappointed. The cozy bedroom barely fit a twin mattress and a nightstand. The  window actually offered a view of a brick wall.
 Julie didn't give up hope though. The next apartment she saw was advertised as  having a renovated kitchen. Since Julie loved to cook, she imagined herself cooking  gourmet meals on shiny new kitchen appliances. However, the broker showing Julie  around explained that the only renovations were new knobs on old wooden cabinets.
 Julie was beginning to lose hope. She then saw a listing for a basement apartment  with access to a low maintenance yard. Julie imagined herself hosting barbecues for  her friends until she saw that the low maintenance yard was a tiny slab on concrete.
 Julie decided to stop looking for apartments that had features she liked. Instead  she was going to look for an apartment close to her job. She read a listing for a  studio that was close to a freeway. This meant a shorter commute. When she saw the  place, she found that the studio actually overlooked the freeway, and traffic could be  heard from the bedroom.
 Julie was discouraged. She decided not to move out yet.

159. TRICK OR TREAT
 It was Laura's first Halloween in the United States. She had seen many portrayals  of the late October holiday on television and in movies. She had to admit she was a  little excited and nervous about the day. She was excited to see the costumes worn  by kids ringing her doorbell; she was also worried about being scared by the  costumes. She had watched too many horror movies.
 Laura was renting a room in a house. Her landlady asked her if she could help  with the candy. Laura happily agreed. The sun was just starting to set when the first  group of kids in costumes rang the doorbell. "Trick or treat!" they said  enthusiastically when Laura opened the door. The kids all had open bags. "I want a  treat!" Laura said and grabbed the candy from each of the bag. The landlady came  running to the door. "No, Laura. You give the kids candy, not taking from them," she  explained gently. Thankfully, none of the kids were upset. They just looked confused.
 The landlady suggested that Laura should go out with some friends to a local  community Halloween carnival. She would handle giving out the candy by herself.
 Laura went to her room to put on her witch costume. She walked to the local  recreation center along with Joe and some other friends. The recreation center was  decorated with fake spider webs and filled with artificial fog. "We're going to egg  some houses," Joe told her. She didn't know that throwing eggs was illegal. She just  thought it was another Halloween tradition.
 A few hours later, the landlady opened the door and found Laura accompanied by  police. "Trick or treat?" Laura asked, looking embarrassed.

160. LEAVING A TIP
 Sharon and Ken just finished a wonderful meal at a fancy restaurant. The service  and food were five-star quality. Ken asked for the check. "How much is the tip?"  Sharon asked. Since she and Ken were just friends, she didn't want him to pay for  the whole meal, but since Ken did invite her, she assumed he was paying. Sharon  thought that offering to put in the tip was a nice gesture. The tip was not going to be  cheap. The meal, complete with a bottle of wine, must have been at least $200. $30  would be 15 percent of a $200 bill, and $40 would be 20 percent of a $200 check.
 Since the service was good, Sharon had no problem giving a 20 percent tip.
 Ken told Sharon that there was no need to leave a tip. Sharon was shocked.
 Maybe Ken didn't think the food was good or maybe he wasn't happy with the  service. This surprised Sharon because Ken seemed to enjoy the entire experience  and didn't complain. "Was something wrong?" Sharon asked Ken. "No," Ken  answered. He explained that he felt tipping was just an American way of showing off  extra wealth. "I think it's vulgar and disrespectful," he continued.
 Sharon knew that Ken wasn't born in the United States and wondered if that had  something to do with how Ken felt. "Well, in the United States, tipping is kind of  expected. Servers generally aren't paid that well and rely on tips to feed their  families. The exception of course is if the service was really bad, but I had a lovely  time. Didn't you?" Sharon asked. "Service was great," Ken agreed, "but why don't  they just pay the servers better so we don't have to pay more?" Sharon agreed with  Ken, but she still left a 20 percent tip.

161. NOT SOLD OVER THE COUNTER
 One of Barb's favorite activities since moving to the United States was watching  television. She especially loved watching the commercials. "You really can buy  anything here in America!" she told her friends. One afternoon she was watching  television and saw a commercial that really grabbed her attention. It showed a  cartoon woman tossing and turning. The woman in the commercial was unable to  sleep because she was busy thinking about the day that had passed and worrying  about the day ahead. Barb wasn't quite sure what the commercial was advertising.
 Was it a bed? Was it a pillow? Was it just a public service announcement urging  people to sleep more? Suddenly a voice on the television began speaking very  quickly, listing side effects of the sleeping pill the commercial was advertising. One of  the side effects was insomnia. Barb thought that seemed like an odd side effect  The next day Barb happened to be in the local neighborhood pharmacy picking up  a few things. She remembered the commercial she had seen the night before for the  sleeping pills. She walked up and down the aisles looking for them. Since she saw it  advertised on television, she thought she might try them. Sometimes she had a hard  time sleeping. When she couldn't find the pills on her own, she walked over to the  pharmacy counter and asked the pharmacist where she could find the pills.
 "Do you have a prescription?" the pharmacist asked. Barn explained that she  didn't, but she saw the pills advertised on television and thought she would try them.
 "Those are not available over the counter," the pharmacist explained. Barb thought it  was dumb for there to be a commercial for something she couldn't just go get at the  store. She walked out of the pharmacy without buying anything.

162. SEEING THE ENTIRE UNITED STATES
 One of the first things Gustav wanted to do when he got to the United States was  to see as much of it as he could. He would be flying into New York City's John F.
 Kennedy airport. In New York he planned to see the Empire State Building and the  Statue of Liberty. Then he wanted to go to Philadelphia to see the Liberty Bell. Then  he wanted to go to the nation's capital, Washington D.C., where he hoped to see the  White House, and maybe he would even see President. He knew that getting to the  three east coast cities He could take a train or bus.
 Gustav wasn't sure though about how he would get to the other parts of the  United States he wanted to see. For example, Gustav really wanted to see the Grand  Canyon in Arizona. He also really wanted to go to Los Angeles to see where some of  his favorite movie stars lived.
 Once in New York City Gustav asked the hotel concierge if they could arrange  some trips for him. The concierge was helpful and informed Gustav about the  different Amtrak trains he could take to Philadelphia and Washington D.C. "What  about the Grand Canyon and Hollywood?" Gustav asked. "What about them?" the  concierge asked, looking confused. "What about trips there?" Gustav asked. The  concierge pulled out a map and showed Gustav how far Arizona and California are  from New York. "A train there will take you about a week. A plane ride will take about  six hours," the concierge explained. Gustav was disappointed. He had no idea that  the United States was such a large country. He was determined to see as much as he  could though. He wondered how much it would cost to rent a camper and drive it  across the U.S.

163. GROCERY SHOPPING
 Kim was a housekeeper for a family in Beverly Hills. One morning when she went  to work, she found a note from her boss. The note asked her to go to the  supermarket and pick up a few things. There was a list of things Kim was supposed  to buy. The note surprised Kim. She had only been a housekeeper for a week and had  never been asked to go shopping before. Kim didn't even know where the nearest  grocery store was. She also didn't know how to drive. Thankfully the note also told  her that the boss's driver would take her to the market. There was also a $50 bill.
 Once at the market Kim walked through looking for the items on her list. She was  confused though. The list read "one pound of apples". Kim had purchased one  kilogram of apples but never a pound. In her country, they used the metric system.
 She wasn't sure if a pound was more or less than a kilogram. Kim decided to ask one  of the grocery workers. The grocery worker was kind and explained that a pound was  about half a kilogram.
 "I wouldn't worry about it though. Just use the scale," the grocery worker said.
 Kim went to the scale and was happy to see that the scales didn't use the metric  system she was used to. Kim weighed a pound of apples and put it in the shopping  cart.
 The next item on the list was a gallon of milk. Kim wasn't sure how much a gallon  was. She was used to buying a liter of milk. There was also no way to weigh a liter of  milk. She was glad that the milk containers were labeled. She just wished the U.S.
 used the metric system.

164. SALES TAX
 John had been saving his allowance for three weeks so that he could buy a  telescope he had seen advertised in the newspaper. According to the advertisement,  the telescope cost $94,99. John also did some odd jobs around the neighborhood  where he lived. He mowed the neighbor's lawn and took another neighbor's dog for a  walk. Finally he had 95 dollars.
 One Saturday John walked to the store. He had brought with him the  advertisement, which he had cut out from the newspaper. He asked a salesperson in  the store where he could find the telescope advertised. He pulled out the newspaper  ad and showed it to the salesperson to make sure they took him to the right one. The  salesperson showed John where the telescopes were and together they looked for the  one he wanted. It was called the Vega 600.
 "I found it!" John told the salesperson. The salesperson confirmed that the Vega  600 cost $94.99 and brought the box to the cash register so that John could pay for  it. John was so excited. He felt like jumping up and down. He had worked so hard to  get this.
 "That will be $104.01," the salesperson told John. "Did you advertise it as  $94.99?" John asked angrily. He thought the salesperson was trying to take  advantage of him. "Yes, it is, but we have to add sales tax. It's the law. In California  the sales tax is 9.5 percent, "the salesperson explained. "Why don't you just put the  final price on advertisements and price tags then?" John asked. "Then everything  seems more expensive and people won't come into the store to buy," the salesperson  explained. "Everything is more expensive!" John said angrily, walking out of the store  without the telescope.

165. "OH, REALLY?"  Maggie was meeting her friend Lisa at a French restaurant downtown for lunch.
 Lisa was visiting New York from Chile. They met in Chile over 10 years ago. That was  the time when Maggie spent a semester abroad as part of her undergraduate studies.
 Lisa was a Chilean student who helped Maggie learn Spanish and how to play soccer.
 Even when Maggie came back to the United States, the two friends kept in touch with  each other via Facebook and Skype.
 Maggie waved to Lisa from the table in the restaurant when she saw her Chilean  friend walk in. Lisa looked the same, just a little older and a little fatter. "Tell me what  is new with you?" Maggie asked Lisa. Lisa explained that she worked for an airline  and was in town on business. "I get to travel all the time now," Lisa told Maggie. "Oh,  really?" Maggie replied. "Yes really, and I can even sometimes get tickets for friends  and family members at really low prices," Lisa continued. "Oh, really?" Maggie  replied. Maggie was annoying Lisa. Lisa was beginning to feel like Maggie didn't  believe what she was saying. "I can show you the memo from my job that explains it  all if you don't believe me," Lisa said angrily. "Why wouldn't I believe you?" Maggie  asked and confused. She thought it was great that Lisa had a job that took her all  over the world, and that even let her do it with friends and family.
 "Well, you keep saying 'oh, really?' like you are challenging what I'm saying," Lisa  said. Maggie explained that when she said "oh really", it just meant she found what  Lisa was saying interesting and wanted her to elaborate. "Oh, really?" Lisa said  before the two friends both burst out laughing.

166. MORE THAN SPORTS
 When William was transferred to a job in Texas, he was really worried about  making friends. On his first day in the factory though, everyone was really friendly.
 "You should join our softball league," his co-worker Richard suggested. "That's a  great idea, thanks, but I don't have a bat or a glove," William said to Richard. Richard  jotted down on a piece of paper the name and address of a local sports supply shop  nearby. "They will have everything you need," Richard said.
 On his day off, William went to the sports shop. "Boy, Rich wasn't kidding,"  William said to himself. Not only did they have bats and gloves, but also equipment  for all kinds of sports. The store also featured an extensive gun selection. "Those are  toy guns?" William asked. The salesperson shook his head. "No, sir. These are all  working weapons. I have some machetes and knives too if you want something more  traditional," the salesperson explained.
 "No, I just came in for some softball equipment," William told the salesperson.
 "Well, you can take home any of these lovely rifles or guns along with your softball  equipment today," the salesperson continued. "I don't need a license?" William asked.
 The salesperson shook his head. "There's no waiting period?" William asked. The  salesperson shook his head again. "I don't have to take a safety course?" William  asked. He couldn't believe it was so easy to buy a gun.
 "No, sir. It's cash and carry here," the salesperson said, "So can I show you a fine  firearm today?" William shook his head. "No, but can I take a picture? My friends  back in New York won't believe it's this easy to buy a gun here." "Sure, buddy," the  salesperson said, "I'll even take a picture of you with any weapons you want."

167. TIME-OUT
 Mildred went to pick up her son Bill from school one afternoon. When she got to  the school, Mildred noticed that Bill looked upset. He was pouting and did not want to  look at her. "What's wrong?" she asked him. "I got in trouble," Bill said in a low voice.
 "What happened?" Mildred asked gently. "I got put in time-out for grabbing a toy  from Mary," Bill said.
 Mildred wasn't sure what a time-out was. She knew that time-outs were called in  sports whenever a player was injured but she wasn't sure how that would be used in  a kindergarten classroom. Mildred was sure though that her son grabbing a toy from  a classmate was not correct. The next day when Mildred took Bill to school, she  stopped the teacher. She asked the teacher to explain what a time-out was. Mildred  told the teacher that Bill was very upset about the time-out he had the day before.
 The teacher explained that time-out was a discipline tool she used in the classroom.
 When she saw Bill grab the toy from Mary, she told him to go into time-out. Time-out  is a chair next to the teacher's desk where a student has to sit quietly when they do  something  "They aren't kicked out of the classroom, just taken out of the immediate  situation so they can reflect on what they did wrong," the teacher explained. Mildred  thought it was an interesting way to teach self-control to little kids. "Can I use this at  home?" Mildred asked the teacher. "Of course!" the teacher said.
 Later that night, Mildred got into an argument with her husband for something. In  the middle of the argument she slammed her hand on the kitchen counter. "Mommy,  you need a time-out," Bill said.

168. SAVING A PIGEON
 When Julia left for school in the morning, she noticed a pigeon sitting very closely  to the front door of her apartment building. Usually pigeons flew away whenever  someone got too close to them, but this pigeon didn't seem to care. Julia didn't think  too much of it though. When she got back home from school that afternoon, she  noticed the pigeon was in the same exact place. It seemed the pigeon hadn't moved  at all. Julia moved closer. She noticed the pigeon had a wound on its wing. She was  worried that a dog or a cat would eat the injured animal. Julie ran upstairs to her  apartment and told her mom about the pigeon.
 "We have to help it!" Julie insisted. Julie's mom made a disgusted face. "I don't  want to. Pigeons have diseases," she said. Julie began to cry. This made Julie's mom  feel bad. She gave in, but she gave Julie some rules. The pigeon had to stay in the  kitchen in a storage bin. Julie's mom didn't want to have to touch the dirty bird.
 Julie put one of her old baby blankets on the bottom of a deep storage bin. While  Julie tried to feed the injured bird bits of moist bread, Julie's mom looked online for  local animal rescue organizations. She felt silly trying to save a pigeon though. Finally  she found an organization that would take the bird, but not until the next morning.
 Julie stayed up all night watching the bird.
 The next morning Julia and her mother took the subway to the bird rescue  organization. Many people on the train gave Julie and her mother strange looks.
 Julie's mother just shrugged. When they got to the rescue organization, Julie told the  worker, "Please take good care of Sebastian".

169. NOT JUST FOR THE OLD AND HOMELESS
 "You want me to buy you what?" Ken asked Elizabeth. He was sure he hadn't  heard her correctly. Elizabeth had just moved in with Ken. She came to Los Angeles  from New York City after a year of long distance dating. "I want you to buy me a  shopping cart," Elizabeth repeated. "In Los Angeles there are two types of people  who use shopping carts. The homeless are one. They use shopping carts to carry  their possessions. Old ladies are the second. They use it to carry their laundry back  and forth, their groceries, and maybe even to sell tamales," Ken explained.
 Elizabeth felt insulted. "Are you saying I'm an old lady?" she asked. She then  continued to explain that she didn't want to rely on Ken to drive her to the  supermarket or the laundromat. Elizabeth didn't know how to drive, but she wanted  to be self-sufficient. "Besides," she continued, "in New York City everyone has a  shopping cart, not just the homeless or old ladies."  One afternoon when Elizabeth came home from work, there was a red shopping  cart in the driveway. Ken had put a big red bow on it. "Do you like your new wheels?"  Ken asked Elizabeth. She felt happy now that she could handle some chores on her  own.
 The next day she loaded the shopping cart with dirty clothes and set off to walk  the three blocks to the nearest laundromat. This was not as easy as she thought. The  sidewalks were uneven and the cart often got stuck, causing dirty socks to leap out of  the cart. Elizabeth had to stop several times to pick up stray clothes. Then nearly  every house between her house and the laundromat had a big dog that barked at her.
 Elizabeth hated big scary dogs.

170. THE FACEBOOK MESSAGE
 Maria received a Facebook notification on her mobile phone, which says: "You  have a new message from Jimmy." Maria didn't know any Jimmy except an ex boyfriend ten years ago. Maria opened the message and sure enough it was from the  man she dated a long time ago.
 "You should Google me and see what I've been up to," the message said. Maria  thought the message was strange, but out of curiosity, she typed in Jimmy's full  name in the Google search bar. She saw pictures of him and a number of articles. The  articles were about him filing for divorce from his wife who was a high school teacher  in New York City. She had been accused of having an affair with one of her students.
 She had been fired and was facing criminal charges. She had a daughter with Jimmy,  a successful attorney.
 "Is your mind blown?" Jimmy wrote in a separate Facebook message after a while.
 Maria didn't know if she should respond. Why was he reaching out to her after so  many years? Did he want her to know he was divorced so that they could date again?
 Maria decided to play along. "Yes, my mind is blown, and I hope things have settled  down for you and your daughter," Maria typed. Jimmy didn't respond that night.
 Maria thought it would be the last time she heard from Jimmy.
 A week later Maria received another Facebook notification. It was another  message from Jimmy. "I was hoping that you would have time in your busy schedule  to see me," the message read. Maria hesitated. When they stopped dating years ago,  it was because Jimmy had written a cruel message to her. Should she give him  another chance?

171. PAINTBALLING IN THE CITY STREETS
 Scott received a paintball gun and some paintballs from his mom for his 16th  birthday. When his mom gave him the present, she told him that she would take him  to a paintball range with some of his friends. The range was in an open field and the  company that owned the range provided safety equipment like padding and  facemasks. Getting hit by a paintball hurt and could cause serious injury. The  paintball range was 20 miles away, and Scott had to wait till the weekend to try out  his new equipment. He didn't want to wait that long. He wanted to play with his new  toy now.
 When his mom was taking a nap, he texted a friend who lived down the block to  meet him in front of his house. "I want to show you what I got for my birthday,"  Scott told his friend. He loaded up the paintball gun with the colored balls filled with  brightly colored paint. He started shooting it at the trashcans that were on the curb.
 Just then a police patrol car was driving down the street. Scott missed the trashcans  and ended up shooting a paintball right at the police car. The police thought they  were under attack. Scott knew he had done something wrong and ran inside the  house with his friend. Soon a police helicopter was flying overhead, and Scott could  hear police sirens approaching his house.
 The sounds of the helicopter and the sirens woke up Scott's mother. She looked  out her window and saw a spotlight right on her house, and three police cars arrived.
 "What is going on?" she wondered aloud. She went to the living room and turned on  the local news to see if there was any information about what was happening in her  neighborhood.

172. INCREASING THE HOME VALUE
 Bob knew that the house he just purchased was in a historically rough  neighborhood. There was a history of gang violence, including shootings, in the  neighborhood. That is probably why the house was so inexpensive. The previous  owners of the house had it foreclosed. Then some house flippers bought the property  for a very cheap price, renovated it, raised the sales price, and sold it. Bob thought  the house was still a good bargain though.
 After he moved in, Bob began to see that many of the renovations to the home  were merely cosmetic. While the house flippers put in new stainless steel appliances  in the kitchen, they hadn't upgraded the electrical work. This meant that every time  Bob ran the dishwasher and the coffee machine, all the power in the house went out.
 Bob spent over $1,000 dollars to have the house rewired. The new carpets that the  house flippers installed was put over the original hardwood floors. Bob decided to rip  out the ugly oatmeal colored carpets and refinish the old floors. That was another  $3,000.
 The house was an old stucco house that got very hot in the summer and cold in  the winter. The house flippers installed some cheap windows. Bob hired a contractor  to put in new double pane storm windows and install ceiling fans. That was another  few thousand dollars. Bob wanted to make the house energy efficient, so he leased  solar panels that were installed on the roof. This not only lowered his monthly electric  bill, but added value to the home.
 Within two years, all the changes Bob made to the house totaled more than  $20,000. In that time the value of his home rose almost $100,000. Bob felt he made  a good investment. He knew when he sold the home, he would get more money than  he paid.

173. GROWING UP PLAYING BASEBALL
 When Johnny was a kid, all he talked about was becoming a baseball star. Of  course he wasn't alone. Most young boys growing up in the United States want to  become a major league baseball player at one time or another. He remembers  watching his favorite players on TV when he was young, and how his father would  take him to see the Giants play at Candlestick Park.
 Johnny recalls the old stadium, and how big it seemed to him as a child. His dad  took him onto the field one day when the team was having a photo day. Johnny  couldn't believe how big the field was. All his favorite Giants were there taking  pictures with fans. "Can I take a picture with Willie Mays, dad?" Johnny asked  gleefully. "Of course, Johnny. Let's get in line," said his dad. Willie Mays was one of  the greatest players to ever play the game, and he loved kids, too. That is why the  line to take a picture with him was so long. Johnny didn't mind though. He was in  baseball heaven.
 The Giants played their archrival, the Los Angeles Dodgers, that day. There had  always been a bit of bad blood between the two teams over the years. It started  when both teams were based in New York. They were cross-town rivals at that time.
 After the teams moved to California in the late 1950s, the rivalry continued.
 The Dodgers were always one of the better teams in the National League, and  even though Johnny grew up a Giants fan, he really didn't hate the Dodgers. "I think  the rivalry was blown up, to tell the truth," Johnny said years later. Baseball fans are  very fickle and stubborn though, and some play the rivalry up as much as they can.
 No true Dodger, or Giant fan would ever admit liking the other team in public, but  Johnny suspects there is a mutual respect for each team in both cities.

174. MY DAY ON THE OCEAN
 Last week Chris went on her first deep sea fishing trip off the coast of Catalina  Island. She had always enjoyed fishing when she was a child, but had never gone  fishing in the ocean. Her dad liked to fish very often. Her big brother Jack was never  the outdoor type, so her dad took her out often. One of his favorite spots was Lake  Isabella, which was about two hours from their home. She recalls how she and her  dad would spend a long, leisurely day driving to the lake, and then taking his small  boat out on the water. It was quiet and peaceful for the most part. Those memories  remain some of her most cherished moments of her life.
 Chris has a friend called Robert. On this day, Robert invited Chris to join him on  his company's fishing trip. Robert said it wouldn't cost much, but would be a lot of  fun. He knew Chris enjoyed lake fishing and figured she would have a great time.
 "Okay," said Chris, and to the ocean they went.
 The first thing Chris noticed, however, was the motion. "Wow, this boat really  rocks," Chris told Robert. "Don't worry about it. You will get used to it," he said. The  trip to the waters off Catalina Island took about an hour. Chris marveled at how  quickly she lost sight of the mainland. It was a bit scary when she thought about how  alone they were in this great ocean. Soon, it was time to collect squid for bait. The  small boat stopped in the water, and the crew turned the bright light into the ocean  to attract the squid. Before long, thousands of squid rose to the surface and were  collected for bait.
 After about an hour, Chris didn't feel the rocking motion anymore. They were  ready to fish. Chris caught her first ocean trout. It was a beautiful day.

175. GREEN HAIR, DON'T CARE
 Tina was very involved in her daughter's education. She made sure her daughter  did her homework. She also volunteered at her school. She especially liked to help  parents who did not speak English. Tina often would translate at parent-teacher  conferences and meetings. She also translated some of the papers that the school  sent home. Tina was a member of the parent-teacher association. She went to every  meeting and open forum. Tina was so active in her daughter's school that she was  elected to be vice-president of the parent-teacher association.
 The principal of the school did not like Tina though. She felt Tina was too  involved. She didn't like how Tina insisted that there be translation at every meeting,  and that every paper that went home be in different languages. The principal felt Tina  was creating more work for her and her staff. She thought Tina was a troublemaker.
 The way Tina looked didn't help her. She had many tattoos, and often dyed her  hair in non-traditional colors like pink and green. One evening, after Tina's daughter  received an award for her good grades, Tina went up to greet the principal. The  principal responded coldly: "Congratulations." The principal then offered some advice  to Tina's daughter. "When you grow up, don't become like your mother," the principal  told the young girl. The little girl was confused. Tina was furious. How dare the  principal speak to her that way? Tina may not have looked like all the other parents,  but what she looked like shouldn't matter. Tina's daughter hugged her mother. "I  don't care that you have green hair, mommy," she said, "I care that you care about  me and my school."

176. HOSPICE CARE
 Millie's sister Arlene had been battling breast cancer for five years. Then the  doctor gave Arlene some bad news. The cancer had spread to her brain and there  was no treatment that would cure her. "I'll keep taking care of you," Millie told her  sister. Millie and Arlene were both in their 50s, but Millie was 5 years older than  Arlene. Arlene would always be Millie's little sister. Throughout Arlene's illness, Millie  took care of things. Millie went with Arlene to all of her appointments. Millie went to  all of Arlene's chemotherapy and radiation treatments. When Arlene lost her hair  because of the chemo, Millie helped her pick a natural-looking wig. Arlene was  appreciative, but also felt bad. Millie had a family of her own to take care of, and yet  she spent most of her time taking care of Arlene.
 Arlene told Millie she wanted to be put in a hospice. Millie did not know what that  was. Arlene's doctor gave the sisters some brochures. The brochures explained that  hospice care would try to make Arlene as comfortable as possible by providing pain  management. They also focused on the emotional health of patients and their  families by providing counseling. Millie was reluctant to place Arlene in hospice. Millie  felt like she was abandoning her baby sister. Arlene insisted though.
 "It's about time someone else wait on me hand and foot," Arlene joked. Millie  went with Arlene to check into the hospice. Not only did the staff take care of Arlene,  they also had activities for Millie, a member of the family. The staff told Millie that she  could even spend the night here when she wanted. They asked Arlene what some of  her favorite foods were so their chef could make what she liked. Arlene felt  comfortable in the hospice.

177. DIVING AT THE SWIMMING POOL
 Donald Walker always looked forward to summer. As he sat down in class, he  thought about all the things he was going to do during his summer break. He even  made a list. On the top of his list was swimming. Donald loved to go swimming. Even  though he was excited to get a break, there was something, or someone he was  going to miss. Sarah Lee Parker was his classmate, but he rarely talked to her.
 Donald liked Sarah a lot. He knew he was going to miss her.
 The first day of summer had arrived. Donald woke up around noon. He hated  waking up early for school, so he wanted to sleep late for the first day of summer. As  soon as he woke up, he put on his swimming shorts, got a towel, kissed his mom  goodbye, and ran to the park to go to the pool. As Donald jumped into the pool, his  heart began to beat fast. The water was clear, but cold.
 One of Donald's favorite things to do at the pool was to go on the diving board. As  Donald stood on the edge of the diving board, he started jumping in order to get high  enough to do a flip. He jumped once, and then twice. When he was about to jump off  again, he saw that Sarah was looking at him from the entrance of the pool. Donald  got so nervous that he couldn't finish the flip, and he landed on his back. Everyone in  the deep end of the pool started laughing. Donald felt embarrassed as he swam to  the edge of the pool, but when he got there he saw Sarah waiting for him. "Ouch,  that had to hurt. You want to go swimming with me?" Sarah asked Donald. Donald  said sure nervously, and started swimming with Sarah. Donald had never been  happier, and never been in that much pain.

178. WATCHING THREE MOVIES AT THE THEATER
 Betty Gonzalez likes going to the movies. She likes to wait until there are multiple  movies she wants to see. She'll usually go early in the day in order to see at least  two movies. Betty is proud that her record is seeing four movies in one day. She  usually sneaks in snacks to eat at the movie theater. Betty doesn't care if no one  wants to go with her; she'll go alone and have fun.
 It was Saturday morning. Betty saw that there were three movies she wanted to  see showing at the theater. Betty got her purse and made herself two sandwiches,  bought a soda, got her sweater, and went to the movies. After she had seen two of  the movies, she bought a soda and was going to sneak into the next movie. As Betty  walked up to the room where the movie was showing, she noticed that a man was  checking for tickets. Betty began to get nervous.
 Betty didn't have a ticket, but she really wanted to see this movie. She did not  like the other two movies; she knew she was going to like this one, because her  favorite actor was in it. The man that was checking for tickets stopped Betty as she  tried to pass him. He asked her for her ticket. Betty didn't know what to do. The man  was speaking in English, so Betty decided to speak in Spanish.
 She told the man something in Spanish, and then walked off while she was still  talking. The man was confused, and he didn't know what to do. Betty looked like she  was mad at the man, so he didn't want to do anything else to get her even angrier.
 He just let her go through. When Betty got to her seat, her heart was still beating  fast. She started laughing. She took a sip of soda and watched the movie in peace.

179. I HATE SUMMER
 Paul Young and Mark Allen were good friends. They both hated summer. Paul  hated that it was always hot. Mark hated that the park by his house was always  crowded. "I hate summer," Paul told Mark as they played video games in Mark's  room. "I know. Besides not going to school, there is nothing else that's good about  summer," Mark said.
 As the two friends played their game, Mark's mom started getting upset with the  boys. "Why don't you boys go outside?" Mark's mom asked. Mark replied, "Too many  people, and it's too hot." Mark's mom had enough; she unplugged the game and told  Mark that they had to go outside and do something else. They decided to go to the  arcade, because at least there they could play games and be inside an air conditioned building.
 When they got there, they realized that two of their friends were at the arcade,  too. It was Susan and Carol. Paul liked Susan; Mark didn't really like Carol that much,  but he agreed to stay with Carol, so that Paul could hang out with Susan alone.
 "Don't do anything stupid, Mark," Paul said. "Oh, shut up and go talk to Susan," Mark  said. Paul went up to Susan and asked her if she wanted to play a shooting game  with him. She said yes. After they played the game, they went back to meet with  Carol and Mark.
 "You know, Carol and I were about to leave. You guys want to come with us?"  Susan asked the boys. "Sure, where to?" Paul asked. Susan said that they were going  to the park, because she liked to see all the people having fun there. "Awesome, I  love going to the park during the summer," Paul said. He looked at Mark and  whispered, "Shut up, don't say anything." They all left, and Mark looked like he was  going to cry. "I hate summer," Mark said to himself.

180. JUMPING OVER FIREWORKS
 Nancy Young had always loved celebrating the Fourth of July, the holiday that  celebrates America's independence. She loved the meaning of the day. She also loved  lighting fireworks. She loved all types of fireworks. Nancy had three brothers, and  they all loved the Fourth of July. Nancy's youngest brother Peter loved lighting up the  fireworks. Although Nancy's parents didn't have that much money, they decided to  buy a lot of fireworks for their children. They wanted their children to have a great  Fourth of July. Once they got the fireworks, Nancy decided to split them with her  brothers. She got the most, and her brothers got the rest.
 Nancy's parents decided to go to the park to light the fireworks this year. Peter  decided to light the first one. It exploded, and scared Nancy. Nancy decided to light  one. It was a sparkler, which meant that it would only send sparks up into the sky,  and would not explode. Nancy loved how it looked. She lit another one to see how it  would look like. Peter had the idea to jump over the fireworks. Even though Nancy  said no, Peter decided to jump over it.
 Peter got ready. He tied his shoes to make sure his shoe laces weren't hanging  out of his shoes, and that he had enough distance to jump over the sparks. Peter  started running and then jumped. When he landed on the other side, he started  screaming in pain. A spark had gotten into Peter's eye. He fell to the ground and  started asking for ice. Nancy brought him a bag of ice to cover his eye. During the  next day, Peter had to get glasses because of the damage he had suffered in his eye.
 The doctor asked him, "What's the important lesson here?" Peter responded with,  "Don't jump over fireworks."

181. A PROBLEM WITH ONLINE DATING
 I was 10 years old when we first got a computer. I didn't know what to do with it,  so I just played video games on it. My brother was six years older than me, so he  would use the computer to go into chat rooms. After we had had the computer for  around a year, I noticed my brother would always be in chat rooms. He would always  have a private message open as well. It took me another year to realize that my  brother was dating someone online.
 I always knew my brother's girlfriend as SnowBunny85, because he never told us  officially that she was his girlfriend. I later found out her name was Lily. My brother  always tried to be careful not to leave any pictures Lily sent him on the desktop of  the computer, but sometimes he would. She looked pretty. I didn't understand why  my brother wanted, or felt that he needed to keep his relationship secret.
 A few years later, my brother told me that he had broken up with a girlfriend he  had. I asked why, but he didn't want to talk about it. I found out what really  happened one day while I was using the computer. My brother had saved his last  conversation with Lily. It seemed like Lily had lied to my brother. They had met a  couple of times in real life, and they seemed to have had a real relationship. The only  problem was that Lily already had a husband. My brother was crushed to find out that  she was married. On that day I realized that an online relationship is risky. It's up to  you to find someone that you can trust and hopefully isn't lying to you. I hope my  brother realized that, too.

182. WHAT ARE FRIENDS?
 Friends make life easier, or at least they should. My best friend's name is Susan. I  call her Suzy. Suzy and I would always hang out together. Just to clarify, my name is  Michael. Yes, I am a boy, and Susan is a girl. Everyone that knew us always thought  we were in a relationship, but that wasn't the case. I loved Suzy like a sister, and she  loved me like a brother. Well, I used to think she did.
 It all started when Suzy got a boyfriend. I was happy for her, because she was  sad and lonely. Those were her words, not mine. When she introduced me to Richard,  her boyfriend, I tried my best to get along with him. Although I tried my best,  Richard didn't seem to like me. Maybe his friends told him that Suzy and I were  always hanging around, and they thought we were secretly in love with each other.
 Richard became increasingly jealous whenever my name was mentioned. It  started tearing up their relationship. Suzy began to stay away from me. I would call  her, go over to her house, or wait for her outside of school, but she was always busy  with Richard. She would say, "Sorry, Mike. I'll call you when I get home, okay?" I  knew it was a lie. Suzy and I haven't spoken in a month. As I knew Suzy had always  wanted to go to Las Vegas, so I was going to surprise Suzy by telling her that I was  going to take her. However, it seemed that the ship had sailed. I heard Suzy and  Richard were going to Las Vegas for her birthday.
 I'm moving on, and I'm hanging out with some other friends. It's not the same,  but I guess anyone who chooses a relationship over a friendship was never a good  friend to begin with. Yet, I find myself questioning "What are Friends?"

183. AFTER THE DEATH OF A MUSIC COLLECTOR
 It was a stupid mistake. Before I tell you about my mistake, I have to tell you  about my father. My father Joseph Thomas was a big name in the music business. He  managed a lot of different rock bands in the '60s. By the end of his career, he had  saved up some money and decided to buy himself a cabin in a little town in Oregon.
 He didn't want to live in Los Angeles, New York City, Chicago, or any other big cities.
 He wanted to escape the big city life.
 My father died in that cabin three years ago. I found out about his life in the cabin  a week after he died. He never really liked to answer his cell phone. It would always  be on low battery, or off. He never bothered to charge it. He simply liked listening to  his records and drinking whiskey.
 During his time in the music industry, my father had collected various objects. He  had different items from different artists. He had one of Jimi Hendrix's guitars, and a  medallion that Janis Joplin had given him. Did I know this? No, I didn't. My dad  always kept to himself. He was out on the road a lot, and he never really cared about  keeping in touch with his kids.
 So, when he died, I figured all of his stuff at the cabin would be garbage. I told  the town's Sheriff to throw everything out. I also told him to send me the paperwork  for the cabin. I read about the discovery they made in my father's cabin. I couldn't  believe it! Hendrix's guitar sold for over a million dollars, and so did the medallion. As  I had already asked the Shariff to throw out everything as garbage, I wasn't entitled  to anything, which probably made my father happy.

184. MY FIRST ROAD TRIP
 My first road trip was horrible. When I turned 24 years old, my father lent me his  car to go from Los Angeles to Chicago. I told my dad that my friend George was  going with me, and he was bringing his girlfriend Nancy. My dad liked that George  was going, because he was a responsible young adult, which made me think that my  dad doesn't think of me as an adult. When the day we were scheduled to leave  arrived, George's girlfriend didn't arrive at my house until 5 p.m. when we agreed we  would meet at 2 p.m.
 It wasn't bad. I had been waiting for this road trip for a year. I could wait a little  longer. When Nancy arrived, we packed up her suitcase and hit the road. I was  friends with both of them, but George was my friend first. I started getting annoyed  with them right away. Even though I had my music playing in the car, I could still  hear them in the back kissing and calling each other baby, sweetie, sweetheart, and  other nauseating cute names. I didn't like it, but what was I going to do?
 George took over the wheel after we left California. He was talking to Nancy the  whole time. When we got near the Grand Canyon, Nancy started talking about how  she always wanted to go see it. That was when George said those seven words I  hated the most, "What my baby wants, my baby gets." He started going down a road  that led to the Grand Canyon without even asking me. I started to get really  annoyed, but decided not to say anything. It was really late, but they didn't care. It  turned out the road that led to the Grand Canyon closed after a certain time. Nancy  felt embarrassed, and George started apologizing to me. After we got back on the  highway, I drove all the way to Chicago. George knew that I was bugged, so he tried  to keep me company. He even told Nancy to sit in the back, which she did. It was a  horrible drive. I couldn't believe I had to drive all the way back to Los Angeles with  them.

185. DON'T DRINK AND DRIVE
 One of the most important lessons you should learn is when you drink, you  shouldn't drive. I learned this the hard way. Last year, I got a DUI, which means  Driving Under the Influence. If you get pulled over and you smell like alcohol, the  police will ask you to take a breathalyzer test. When you do the test, you have to  blow really hard into a machine, which will then tell you if you are over the limit to  drive a vehicle. The limit is usually .08 blood alcohol volume. So, if you pass that, you  are going to jail.
 Even though you won't go to jail for a long time, you will be suffering the  consequences of your mistake for a long time. Here is a list of the things you will  have to do if you get a DUI: go to court, go to alcohol education classes, go to  Alcoholics Anonymous, pay a lot of money in fines. If you don't want to pay, you will  have to do community service. I got my DUI almost two year ago, and I am still  suffering the consequences. I still have 56 hours for community service.
 I have to update my insurance policy, and deal with the Department of Motor  Vehicles. You waste a lot of time and money. It gets difficult to get a job, because you  have to let your future employer know that you have been arrested. It's not worth it.
 If you are thinking about going out to celebrate and party with friends and family, do  one of the following: get a designated driver, take the bus or train, or call a cab. It  may cost you a little bit of money, but compared to how much money you will lose if  you get a DUI, it's nothing. Don't drink and drive.

186. SEEING A MIDNIGHT SCREENING
 When a movie is going to premiere, the theater will usually show the film during a  midnight screening. Anthony Baker and his girlfriend Linda Moore love going to see  new movies at midnight. A lot of people usually show up early to make line. Anthony  likes going to stand in line and talk to different people that are in the line. Anthony  told Linda about the new movie that was coming out. Linda went online to buy the  tickets. She wanted to make sure that they would get tickets.
 Linda got an email from the theater. It said that she could pick up the tickets at  the theater. Anthony took Linda out to eat before they went to the theater to wait in  line. Anthony was excited because the movie they were going to see was the sequel  to one of Anthony's favorite movies. When they got to the theater, Anthony and Linda  went to the back of the line and started talking to the people in the back. They all  seemed friendly, and some of them actually knew Anthony and Linda.
 After about an hour of waiting in line, the theater started letting people in.
 Anthony hugged Linda and started jumping up and down. Linda loved going to the  theater with Anthony. He seemed like a little kid when he was there. It always put a  smile on Linda's face. When they got inside, Anthony and Linda found their seats.
 They noticed everyone in the theater started singing a song that came out in the first  movie, so Anthony got up and started clapping and singing along. Linda looked up at  Anthony and thought to herself, "It's a whole different experience seeing a midnight  screening.

187. GOING TO THE BEACH
 Some of the most popular places to visit during summer are the beaches. Kenneth  Green loved going to beaches. He lived close to Venice Beach, and could walk to the  beach in 30 minutes. He could smell the ocean whenever he woke up. Kenneth and  his friends decided to go to the beach the first day of the summer. When they got  there, they found it was filled with tourists and people trying to escape the heat.
 Even though the beach was filled with people, Kenneth didn't care. He knew all  the cool places to go. He was friends with some shop owners. He was also friends  with the owners of a little Mexican restaurant. He had a little booth reserved for him  during the summer so that whenever he got hungry he didn't have to wait for a table.
 The owners were family friends of Kenneth and they loved having him around.
 Kenneth didn't like to abuse their relationship, so he only went to the restaurant once  or twice a week, and he always left good tips.
 There are a lot of activities to do at the beach. People can go swimming, rent a  bike, play volleyball, or shop around. Kenneth is always careful when he is around  volleyball nets and people bicycling. Last year, he was walking by the volleyball nets  when a large man jumped up to hit the ball, which ended up hitting Kenneth right in  the head. The man ran to Kenneth to make sure he was okay. He was okay, but a bit  dizzy. As Kenneth was trying to get his balance back, he walked right into the path of  a bicycle. He crashed into a woman riding a bicycle, and they both fell down. It  wasn't Kenneth's favorite summer.

188. MY WORST BIRTHDAY
 I had the worst birthday of my life last year. It all started when my sister Donna  invited my ex-girlfriend Jennifer. For some reason, Donna and Jennifer started getting  along after we broke up. "How convenient," I told Jennifer. Donna was always trying  to make my life hell. I guess that's her job as the older sister. She was 20 years old,  while I turned 17 years old last year.
 My mother had worked very hard to keep the party they were going to throw for  me a secret. It didn't work, because Donna had a big mouth, but I was trying to keep  up the secret for my mother's sake. My dad got home from work and told my mom to  get the kids so that we could all go out for dinner.
 We showed up at my favorite restaurant, which has a private room in the back for  parties. Everything went downhill as soon as I opened the door. My other ex-girlfriend  Sarah was there, because she wanted to try and fix our relationship. I'll never forget  the look on Donna's eyes. She looked like she saw a ghost. Donna grabbed Jennifer  and told her to go outside. Jennifer and Sarah never got along. It might have  something to do with me, but I'm not sure.
 Jennifer hadn't seen Sarah, because Donna took Jennifer outside before she had  the chance. I took Sarah by the hand, and asked her who had invited her. She looked  at me confused, because apparently I had invited her through a text message a week  ago. It was true. I invited her, but I never thought she would show up. When Jennifer  finally came into the room, she saw Sarah and became very angry. She looked at me  and started yelling at me. "Why is she here, Jason?" asked Jennifer. I looked at her  equally angry and said, "What are you talking about? What are YOU doing here?"  Jennifer started yelling at Sarah, and Sarah started yelling at Jennifer. They got so  angry that they started fighting, which eventually got us kicked out of the restaurant.
 My mother was crushed when she got there. Donna got grounded for a month. That  was one horrible birthday.

189. MY EMBARRASSING FAMILY
 Let me tell you about my family. They are embarrassing to say the least. The first  time I brought a boy home to meet my parents, they asked him countless questions  that no parent should ask. "When did you lose your virginity? Do you believe in Jesus  Christ? How many sexual partners have you had?" Safe to say, that boy I brought  home stopped talking to me after he met my parents. I stayed single throughout my  time at high school. It was not that I didn't like anyone or that no one liked me. It  was that my parents had a rule. They had to approve of whoever I would be dating.
 Sometimes I thought they had that rule specifically to embarrass me.
 I hate that I can't have normal parents. They are weird. They like collecting old  books, and watching old movies. They listen to old records on an old record player.
 They say that it's better than listening to an iPod. I always let them know that at  least I can listen to my iPod when I go out. The last day of high school had passed,  and I didn't know what I wanted to do. I decided to take a year off and work. My  parents didn't like it, but it was my decision to make.
 I got a job at a little restaurant called "Baker's Cabin". It was a nice restaurant  where people could sit down and have a good steak dinner at a reasonable price. I  liked working there. However, what I liked most was the bartender Paul. He had  barely turned 21, and was already working behind the bar. We started talking. I think  he really likes me, but I don't want things to get awkward when he meets my  parents. One day, my friend Susan told Paul that the only way he could date me was  to meet my parents. Paul went over that night with some records his dad had given  him, and offered them to my parents. They went nuts, and invited him in. They  started asking him questions, but not about his sex life or religious beliefs. The  questions were all about music. They really liked him, and they were actually acting  normal. I think Paul is the guy for me.

190. A NEW ADDITION TO THE FAMILY
 I got out of school at 7 p.m. and didn't have anything to do, so I started walking  home. I lived an hour away from my school, so I got home at around 8 p.m. When I  opened the door to go inside, I saw my brother, my mom, and my brother's girlfriend  all sitting down on the couch. My brother Jeff was sitting with his girlfriend Betty. I  walked in slowly. I looked at my mom, who had tears in her eyes. It was very tense. I  turned to Jeff. "She's pregnant!" Jeff said.
 Jeff and his girlfriend started laughing and said, "Yes!" I started jumping up and  down with joy. I always wanted to be an uncle. My first reaction was to start  screaming, "It wasn't me! I started screaming that because my parents always  thought I was going to be the first one to give them a grandchild. They certainly  didn't think Jeff was going to do it. I gave them each a hug, and I wished them luck.
 After eight and a half months had passed, Betty gave birth to a beautiful baby  boy. My family and I were as happy as it could be. They named the baby Mark. Mark  was the name of my father, who passed away a year ago. My brother said that he  looked like my dad, so he decided to give him the name in honor of my dad. We all  gathered at the hospital and started laughing, talking. We each took turns carrying  the baby. It was the happiest moment in our family's history. We only wished that my  father would have been a part of it. Jeff looked at baby Mark. He told me that my  father's spirit was here. He would always be there to look over and take care of Mark.
 I smiled and gave him a hug.

191. MARRIAGE IS THE END
 William Moore didn't trust the idea of marriage. He came from a broken family.
 His mother and father divorced when he was only 10 years old. Both of his two  brothers had been married twice; each marriage ended in divorce. "Marriage is the  end," William always said. His view on marriage always got in the way of his  relationships. He would go out on dates with women who would always be looking for  something serious. William wasn't looking for that. He wanted someone to have fun  with and that was all.
 William hadn't found someone he felt strongly about in a long time. The last time  he truly felt something for a girl was during his last year of college. Her name was  Linda. Linda was in William's math class, and she always helped William with his  homework. They started hanging out after school, and going on dates every week.
 When William told Linda about his views on marriage, she didn't get scared. In fact,  she liked the idea. "It's a lot of pressure. A lot of guys think that women just want  marriage, you know, I don't. At least not right now," Linda said.
 William decided to give Linda a chance. He liked her. They had the same view on  marriage. Yet, during the final month of school, Linda got an email that changed her  life. She got a chance to go study in Europe. William didn't want Linda to go. Linda  said that it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. William even thought about  proposing to Linda to see if she would stay, but he knew that she would not change  her mind. He let her go. It made William sad. He didn't know if he wanted marriage,  but he really wanted to have someone there for him.

192. RUNNING A MILE
 My last class of the day was my physical education class. I always hated it. For  the past three years, people had found ways to embarrass me. Things weren't so bad  at first. A basketball hit me in the head when I was talking to a girl. I was trying to  climb the big rope in the gym and fell down in front of everyone, who started  laughing. However, the worst thing was yet to happen.
 At the end of a year, we always have a test to see how we have improved. We  have to run a mile. The whole class does this at the same time. I wasn't the fastest  runner, but I knew I could get a good score for this test. For this activity, we have to  go into the locker room and change into our uniform. I left my uniform in my locker  the other day since it was clean. When I opened my locker, I saw a note saying, "Buy  new uniform, loser." Someone had broken into my locker and took my clothes. I told  the teacher, who went into his office and gave me an old uniform that had been left  behind. "Suit up and I'll see you out there," he said.
 I tried tying a rope around the shorts to make them fit, but they wouldn't. The  bell rang, and I knew my teacher would be mad if I didn't get out there. I started  running, and barely got there before he started calling names. After he finished with  the roll call, we started the test. The whole class set off running. I was doing okay at  the beginning. After a while, people started passing me. A lot of people laughed at  my shorts. Then it happened. One guy pushed me out of his way, and I ended up  falling. My shorts fell first, and then I fell to the ground. That was when all the girls  started passing me. One of them shouted, "Ew, he doesn't have clean underwear." I  picked up my shorts, and walked the rest of the mile. It was the most embarrassing  moment in my life.

193. BASEBALL TRYOUTS
 Robert Garcia always wanted to play baseball. He was small and weak, but he  loved playing the game. Robert told his dad that he wanted to play baseball, but he  felt that he was too weak to get into the school baseball team. Robert's dad looked at  him and said, "Son, strength doesn't come from muscles. You never know what you  can do till you try. Go out there and try it. You have to take a chance."  Robert was inspired. He went to the tryouts at school the next day. Even though  Robert was the smallest person at the tryouts, he didn't give up. When the coach  looked at Robert and asked him what he was doing there. "I'm here to tryout, coach,"  Robert said. The coach wanted to laugh, Robert knew it, but the coach stopped  himself. "Okay, let's see what you got," the coach said. He gave him a bat. Robert  stepped up to bat. The pitcher threw the ball, and Robert swung as hard as he could.
 After he opened his eyes, Robert noticed that he had missed the ball. This happened  two more times, and then he was out.
 The coach went out to talk to Robert: "Sorry, son. This sport is not for everyone."  Robert didn't understand. He felt angry and sad. He thanked the coach for the  opportunity, and started walking off the field. Then he heard some of the guys  making fun of him for being small. Robert couldn't take it anymore. He started  running home. The coach saw Robert start running and couldn't believe how fast he  was running. Robert was running faster than the team's fastest player. The coach told  his assistant, "Go to the office and get me the home number for that kid." Robert got  home, and his dad told him the good news. He had gotten on the team. Robert  couldn't believe it. He heard the coach's message, "Sorry for not believing in you,  Speedy. Welcome to the team."

194. THE SCHOOL DANCE
 Charles and Richard were known around the school for being troublemakers. They  weren't allowed to attend the school dance, because they had gotten caught trying to  sneak into the girls' locker room. Although Charles and Richard always got in trouble,  sometimes they didn't deserve it. They just had a bad reputation. That's what  happens when you have a bad reputation. The school dance was coming up. Charles  and Richard had a plan on how to sneak in. They were really troublemakers this time.
 It was the tradition that before each dance, the school band would perform the  school's song. Along with the band, our mascot would come out to dance. Our mascot  was a bulldog, but we had both a male and a female bulldogs. Charles and Richard  decided to go into the dance as the bulldogs. They convinced the students who were  going to be the mascots not to go.
 On the night of the dance, Charles and Richard entered the gym as the mascots.
 They were dancing and running around the dance floor as mascots are supposed to  do. Then the principal came up to say a few words and introduce the school band.
 Charles and Richard had a plan though. After the band started playing, they got  behind the principal and started carrying him. The principal started yelling, but  Charles and Richard didn't listen. They started walking closer and closer to the pool  that was on the other side of the gym. Before the principal realized what was going to  happen, they let him go directly into the pool. Everyone started laughing. Charles and  Richard ran out of the gym quickly. No one realized they were Charles and Richard.
 Of course, the next day they got caught. They were really in trouble.

195. A JEALOUS GIRLFRIEND
 Kevin Turner was a trusting guy, but his girlfriend Carol Adams wasn't so trusting.
 Whenever Kevin wanted to hang out with his friends, Carol would look at him and  say, "Who are you really seeing?" At first Kevin took it as a joke, but soon Carol  started getting carried away with it. When he went out with her, she would lie about  not having her phone just so that she could see his phone. She would check his text  messages and calls. She would check his Facebook and Twitter.
 I asked Kevin one day why he was still with her. He simply said that he had a  plan. I was curious about his plan, but he didn't want to tell me what it was. After  they had been going out for a couple of months, Kevin started going out to clubs, and  Carol would always tag along. Kevin would say that he forgot his wallet and if she  could pay. Apart from being jealous, Carol was actually willing to pay for a lot of  Kevin's things. It turned out that all that jealousy had turned Kevin into a different  person. Kevin started getting Carol to buy him things. She paid for his cell phone, for  his car payments, for his clothes, and for his rent. I asked Kevin why he was still with  her. He told me that he had another plan.
 One day, Carol had a fight with her best friend. When it was all over, she went to  talk to Kevin at his house, but he wasn't home. It turned out that Kevin had always  liked Carol's best friend. He kept it secret, but once he found out that they had  started fighting, he realized that it was his chance. Kevin eventually got in a  relationship with Carol's best friend; Carol eventually got over Kevin. "Jealousy is not  a good look on a person," Kevin said. He told me that he did what he did because of  how jealous Carol was.

196. SKATING FOR GLORY
 Brian Nelson got his first skateboard when he was 9 years old. He started skating  right away. He had friends at school that knew how to skate, so he would go to their  houses after school. As time went by, Brian got better and better at skating. He could  do a lot of tricks on his skateboard, but what Brian really loved was jumping over  stairs with his skateboard. His record was 15 stairs, but he wanted to beat that  record. Brian and his friends went to the Hollywood 18, where a lot of skaters go to  make skating videos.
 Brian knew that if he jumped over those stairs, he would become a legend with  his friends. As he went up to the stairs, he started counting each stair one by one. He  wanted to make sure they passed 15. On his first try, Brian jumped off his skateboard  and landed on the grass next to the stairs. He wanted to try again, but he was  scared. He finally got the nerve to try it again. This time he actually jumped over  some stairs. Unfortunately, he didn't pass the 16th step in the staircase. He fell off  his board, but he didn't get that hurt. Some girls were looking at Brian, and asked  him if he could do it again. Brian knew he had to get it this time.
 As Brian prepared for his jump, he kept looking at the girls that had gathered to  see him. He was breathing heavy, but he knew he could do it. The time had arrived.
 Brian was ready to try it again. He pushed off the pavement, and started pedaling his  skateboard faster and faster. He got to the top of the stairs and then he jumped.
 Brian was in the air for about 5 seconds and then he landed. The girls all applauded,  and then Brian stopped his skateboard. He had done it. He beat his record. All the  girls went up to give him a hug, but they all stayed away because he smelled. He  started laughing. Everyone laughed and congratulated Brian.

 When Donna was a little girl, she had a dog named Sandy. Sandy was a furry,  brown, medium-sized dog. She weighed about 25 lbs., and was a happy dog. Donna  was only 10 years old, and couldn't remember a day in her life without Sandy by her  side. Sandy was Donna's best friend.
 The two could be seen together on most days. Donna cared for Sandy every day.
 She fed her, brushed her, and played with her. Donna went with Sandy whenever it  was time to take her to the veterinarian's office for a physical checkup. Donna always  wanted to be with her furry friend on those occasions because she didn't want Sandy  to feel alone and afraid. Donna was also responsible for cleaning up after Sandy,  which meant picking up her poop. Donna didn't mind though. She loved Sandy.
 One day, Donna and Sandy were coming home from the park. They were walking  down the street near their home when Donna let Sandy off her leash. Donna knew  she wasn't supposed to let her off the leash, but she always did when they were just  a few houses away. Sandy would run into the yard, yelping and howling while waiting  for Donna to get home.
 This day was different though. Sandy saw a cat across the street and started  running after the cat just as Donna's neighbor was driving home. Sandy was hit and  killed by the speeding car as Donna screamed in shock. "No!" yelled Donna, but it  was too late. Sandy was gone. Donna was very sad. She blamed herself for Sandy's  tragic death, but her mom told her that Sandy was happy in Heaven now. Donna held  a little service for her doggie and buried her in the back yard so that Sandy would  always be near her. Donna knew they would be together again.

198. DECORATING THE CHRISTMAS TREE
 One of the favorite American holidays is Christmas. The holiday has a special  meaning to most Americans today. It is an official government holiday celebrated on  December 25. Most Americans get both Christmas Day and Christmas Eve off from  their jobs so that they can spend time with their families. Many people are busy  buying gifts for their loved ones in preparation for the big day. Christmas day is the  time when families open presents that they have given each other. The presents are  wrapped in beautiful paper, and usually include a colorful bow and a tag with a  person's name on it. These presents are placed under a tree that is brought into their  home and decorated with bright ornaments by the entire family.
 When Michelle was a little girl, she loved helping her mom and dad decorate the  Christmas tree. It all began by going to a Christmas tree lot, where vendors sold  freshly cut trees to the public. Families can walk through the lots to pick the tree that  is right for them. Michelle loved going to shop for a tree because of the sweet aroma  that would come from the trees. "I like this one, daddy," Michelle said. "It's perfect,"  her dad agreed and bought the tree. It was just the right size, with full, green  branches.
 Once the tree was brought home, Michelle helped her mother place the tree in the  right spot, and began decorating it. Her brothers and sister would help, too. This was  always a great family tradition. They put a string of flickering lights around the tree,  along with pretty ornaments of different kinds. Each family member got to place their  own special ornament on the treeMichelle turned to her fatheranted to. The colors  blue, red, yellow, and red would blink on and off and would shine brightly, reflecting  off the ornaments. As the family stood and viewed the decorated tree, all were  smiling. Michelle turned to her father and said, "Thank you, daddy."

199. CRUISING THE BOULEVARD
 Steven Baker loves his car. He owns a beautiful 1977 Chevrolet Corvette that he  bought many years ago. Steve, as he is known to his friends, got a great deal on the  car. He bought it from a guy who was the original owner. This is the best possible  situation a used car buyer can find. The car culture in California is unique. Detroit  automakers look to California for trends to include into their car designs. Many people  in California like lower cars, which make them look sleeker and more streamline. This  comes from the practice of cruising the boulevard, an activity that is very popular  among people of all ages, among people of all ages,  It was Saturday night in August. Steve gave me a call to see what I was doing  that night. "Hey, let's go cruising, brother," said Steve. And of course I said yes. I  loved cruising in his car. The girls loved that car. It was a two-seater with a T-top roof  that is removable. That night we cruised Van Nuys Blvd., a popular street where lots  of young people like cruising. This is where guys can meet girls and vice versa. It  wasn't long before we spotted a car load of girls in an old Ford Thunderbird. "Hey!" I  shouted to the girls as we came up near them. "Anyone want to cruise with us?" I  said, and to my surprise a couple of young blondes jumped in and we drove away. It  was a tight fit, but the girls were small and thin. I was in heaven! Before long, I was  dating one of them, and Steve dated the other.
 We went on a few double dates after that, but Steve and his folks moved away  one year later and I never heard from him again. That was a sad day in my life, but  at least I had a new girlfriend, thanks to him and his 1977 Corvette!

200. A DAY AT THE BEACH
 "My dad's taking us to Santa Monica today," said Carol. "Do you want to go with  us?" Laura loved to go to the beach, so she said she would be happy to. Santa Monica  beach is one of the most beautiful beaches in California. There are more scenic views  on the coastline up and down the state, but many are inaccessible to beachgoers.
 Santa Monica has a very large beach area that features white sand and lots of room  to play. Carol liked to toss a Frisbee around with her friends and to play volleyball.
 "Do you want to play volleyball, Laura," Carol asked when they got there. "Sure,"  said Laura, "but who are we going to play with? It takes more than two people to  play." Carol thought about it, and said that they should start playing and others will  join in, so the two girls started playing alone. Just as Carol said, more kids came over  and wanted to play with them. Soon they had more than enough people for a game,  and they played for hours.

201. A SOCIAL MEDIA FAST
 Nowadays many people are social media fanatics. They are always looking at their mobile  phones or tablets and updating their Twitter or Facebook accounts. They are taking pictures of  what they eat or taking pictures of themselves, which is called "selfies". When people are not  oversharing, they are constantly reading or looking at what friends and family members are  posting. Social media is becoming addicting.
 Research shows that most people spend on average almost 4 hours a day on social  networking sites. That's almost 30 hours a week. While some people need and use social media  for work or to stay in touch with friends, other people find that using social media so much causes  anxiety and stress. People also tend to use social media as a way to procrastinate. So just as  many religions ask people to abstain, or not to have certain foods or drinks for a certain time,  many people are taking social media fasts. They are not updating their statuses, and they are also  not reading what other people are posting. They choose to stay away from social media for 30  days.
 Ironically, the details of these fasts can be found on social networking sites all over the  Internet. The reasons people undertake a fast are varied. Some people want to reconnect with  their families or friends by disconnecting from their cell phones. Some people want to be more  productive at work. What did some fasters do instead of logging on? Some decided to connect  with friends by actually sitting down and having face-to-face conversations. If friends or loved  ones were far away, they would call them on the telephone instead. Some even wrote handwritten  postcards or letters. The results were mixed. Some people felt that not using social media made  them more anxious. Others developed more positive habits like journaling or meditating.

202. THE PARADE
 The hockey team Los Angeles Kings won the 2014 Stanley Cup, and had a parade last  Monday in Los Angeles to celebrate the victory. During the parade, fans from all over California  came out to support and celebrate with their favorite hockey team. According to the Los Angeles  Police Department, over 200 uniformed officers were sent to the parade to make sure everything  went okay. Although the parade went by without a problem, the LAPD's Public Information Officer  said that there was an increase in alcohol related arrests than when the Kings won the Stanley  Cup in 2012.
 According to Christopher Harris, who attended the parade with his family, a lot of people who  attended the parade had gone to the bars surrounding the Staples Center, and had gotten drunk  before attending the parade. "I saw one person throw up on the street in front of a policeman.
 They put him in the back of the police car," Harris said. The cheers from the crowd started getting  louder and louder as the players from the Kings started passing by.
 Robert Lopez, who attended the parade even though he was rooting for the New York  Rangers, said that the Kings fans started getting really annoying. He was pretty sure it was  because of the alcohol; everyone seemed pretty drunk. Lopez said that he was glad that he didn't  bring his New York Rangers jersey, as he originally planned on, because he said people would  have definitely thrown stuff at him.
 A public relations worker for Los Angeles Kings issued a statement for the hockey  organization saying that they do not condone people to drink before going to attend the parade.
 He went on to say that they took the precaution of having the parade start earlier than it did in  2012 so that people didn't have a chance to go get a drink. It seems as if it still failed.

203. THE QUEEN MARY
 Susan grew up in Lincoln, Nebraska, the heartland of the USA. She remembers playing in the  corn fields as a child, and seeing miles and miles of land stretching out as far as she could see.
 One day her aunt took her to see the 1997 movie Titanic starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate  Winslet. She marveled at the sight of the vast ocean. It was something she had never seen  before. She remembers turning to her aunt to say, "I'm going on a ship like that one day, auntie."  True to her words, Susan left Nebraska, and moved to Los Angeles, California. She wanted to  live near the ocean, and was delighted to discover the Queen Mary was permanently docked in  Long Beach. The grand ship, which has the same size of the Titanic, is now a museum and tourist  attraction. She didn't hesitate to book a tour of the ship. "This is wonderful," she thought to herself.
 Upon arriving on board, Susan was not disappointed. It was everything she hoped it would be.
 The ship was restored to its original state, which was very luxurious. The tour she took highlighted  the ship's history and importance over the years. She ate at one of the three restaurants, and  stayed the night in the ship's hotel. The Queen Mary was built in the 1930s in Great Britain, and  enjoyed many years sailing across the Atlantic Ocean. It was host to many dignitaries such as  Winston Churchill, the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, and many Hollywood celebrities. During  World War II, the ship was assigned as a troop transport where it was used to transport up to  18,000 Allied soldiers per trip.
 After the war, it was restored to its original state, and began its transatlantic travels. In 1967,  the city of Long Beach purchased the aging ocean liner, and it has been a popular attraction for  the city ever since. "It is living history," said Susan, after her visit.

204. A GARAGE BAND
 Many young American boys and girls dream of becoming a rock star at one time or another in  their lives. American culture is largely defined by the music young people enjoy. During the 1960s,  music in the United States was greatly influenced by the social issues of the day. Many call the  decade a revolutionary period in the country's history, and music was a big part of that revolution.
 When David was young, he was in love with the Beatles. The English band was possibly the  most impactful group of the generation. It revolutionized music like no band or artist before them.
 Most young boys wanted to be Paul McCartney, or John Lennon - the two founders of the band.
 Becoming rich and famous in America is one of the attractions of living in the U.S., and becoming  a rock star is one way of achieving this. David knew this, so he got together with three of his  friends and convinced them to form a band together.
 Many American Rock 'N' Roll bands began their journey in someone's garage. One notable  group to start this way was Van Halen. David and his friends were convinced they could become  the next Beatles with a little luck and a lot of practice.
 The band practiced regularly over the years, and soon became good enough to perform  before some young audience, but they never hit the big time unfortunately. The road to success in  the music industry is not an easy one to travel, but that does not deter some American dreamers.
 David's philosophy was "You never know what the future holds," and is engaged in the music  industry to this day. A couple of his original band members are also in the industry enjoying  marginal success, and are still pursuing their dream.

205. MEMORIAL DAY AND VETERANS DAY
 Laura was confused. She came to the United States a year ago. She didn't understand the  difference between Memorial Day and Veterans Day. She knew that both holidays had to do with  remembering and honoring people who had fought in wars for the United States. She also knew  that both days were national holidays. On both days banks, schools and the post offices were  closed; on both holidays, stores offered special sales; on both holidays, people hung the American  Flag, and sometimes there were even fireworks. Laura had seen on television that on both days  the President of the United States made a speech and visited a cemetery laying a wreath on the  grave of a soldier. Laura decided to ask the mailman Brian what the difference was. She figured  he would know since he had both days off from work.
 The next day when Brian was dropping off Laura's mail, she asked him. Brian explained that  Memorial Day is usually observed on the last Monday of May. This meant that it could be on a  different date every year. Memorial day is a day for remembering and honoring those in the  military who died, especially if they died in a battle. Brian also told Laura that Memorial Day was  also considered the unofficial start of summer. Many public beaches would open on Memorial Day.
 Veterans day is a day set aside to thank and honor all people who served in the United States  military. Brian explained that Veterans Day is also to remember those that are still alive. Brian told  Laura that the date for Veterans Day never changes. It is always held on November 11, which was  the date when World War I ended in 1918.

206. THE CHALLENGER DISASTER
 Chris knew exactly where she was on January 28, 1986. As a matter of fact, nearly all  Americans can recall what they were doing at the moment the Space Shuttle Challenger  exploded. It is one of the most tragic moments in the history of the country, and it is one that will  not be forgotten. Chris was working as a clerk at a clothing manufacturing plant in Commerce,  California, which is about three miles from downtown Los Angeles.
 On that morning she was filing some documents when one of her coworkers came through  the door into a large work area that contained about 20 employees. "The shuttle just blew up," he  shouted. Most employees were taken aback. They had no idea what he was talking about. Once  again he blurted out, "The space shuttle just blew up in Florida." Chris knew at that time  something went very wrong.
 The space shuttle program began in the early 80s, and continued to this day. The fleet  consists of various shuttles that are designed to go into space, establish an orbit, and do a variety  of tasks. It was heralded as a new era in space exploration. In the past, space exploration  vehicles were used once, and then discarded. The shuttle program revolutionized the way space  travel was done.
 Chris couldn't believe her ears. Soon almost all employees huddled around the lunch room TV  set watching in horror the events taking place. It was a sad day for the United States, but it was  also the beginning of a new era in space travel. The country rebounded from this disaster and  restarted its program after a couple of years. There have been other accidents in the program,  and most notably the Columbia, which disintegrated upon reentry in February 2003, but the U.S.
 will not be deterred. Space travel is dangerous, but the spirit of the American people will not be  contained.

207. MARCHING FOR SAFER STREETS
 There was a march through the Boyle Heights neighborhood of Los Angeles. The march was  sponsored by a coalition of local organizations and agencies. The purpose of the march was to  bring awareness to the violence in the community. Many people have been killed because of gun  violence and other crimes.
 The march began at 9 a.m. on a busy corner. Many parents brought their children to the  march. The crowd began to walk down the neighborhood sidewalks. Occasionally the crowd  would stop, and an organizer using a bullhorn would tell the story of a person who was killed. After  the organizer told the story, there would be a prayer followed by a moment of silence. There were  relatives of people who had been killed participating in the march. Some of these relatives would  leave lit candles, balloons, or flowers in remembrance of the persons who died. One woman who  died was found in the lake of Hollenbeck Park. Police suspect that her boyfriend killed her. She  had a baby daughter. Her ex-husband participated in the march and asked that organizers include  her in their prayers.
 The march continued for 20 blocks, and ended at Wabash Park. While the march was somber,  the mood inside the park was more celebratory. Different organizations had booths with  information about local programs. There was a craft table for kids to draw picture about the kind of  neighborhood they wanted to live in. Different bands played between speakers offering solutions  to the neighborhood's problems.
 On the same day there was another march at a nearby housing project. In the spring, four  houses were firebombed. Police suspect the attacks were racially motivated. Organizers planned  to hold the march again next year. They really hoped though that conditions in the neighborhood  would improve so they wouldn't have to march.

208. AMBER ALERT
 David's cell phone started vibrating in the middle of the night. He woke up right away and  nervously reached to his nightstand. He always set his cell phone to vibrate and charged it next to  his bed when he went to sleep. David looked at the time on his cell phone. It was two in the  morning. The only time someone contacted him at that hour was when there was an emergency.
 He read the message on his cell phone. It was an emergency. The text message said that a  little boy had been kidnapped near where David lived. The boy had been taken into an orange  Honda Civic. The text message also gave the license plate number of the car. There was also a  picture of the little boy and a written description of what the boy was wearing when he was  kidnapped. The boy's name was Adam.
 David didn't feel like at two o'clock in the morning. He went back to sleep. In the morning,  however, he woke up thinking about the message and about the boy. David had never heard  about an Amber Alert before. He decided to look it up on his computer. He learned that the Amber  Alert system is an emergency broadcast system used to let people know when a child is  abducted. It was named for a little girl named Amber Hagerman, who was kidnapped when riding  her bike in Texas. Little Amber was found dead later.
 The news made David feel sad and angry, but he also felt like now he could do something to  help. He decided to stay aware to see if he saw a boy or a car matching the description in the  Amber Alert.

209. CHILDHOOD FRIENDS
 Ken and Anthony were childhood friends. They went to elementary and high school together.
 They went to college in different states, and then they lost touch. That was twenty years ago.
 One morning Ken was reading the newspaper with his morning coffee. Inside he saw an  announcement for a poetry reading at a nearby bookstore. He was surprised to find that the  featured poet was none other than his friend Anthony. Ken decided to see what his old pal was up  to.
 Ken sat in the last row of the area set up inside the bookstore. When Anthony was introduced  and came up the podium, Ken hardly recognized him. Anthony was almost completely bald and  had a little potbelly. When Anthony was in high school, he was very handsome. What Anthony had  lost in looks was made up for in talent. Anthony's poetry was quite good.
 Anthony recognized Ken sitting in the back row. When the reading was over, Ken stood in line  with the others waiting for Anthony to sign a copy of his book. When it was Ken's turn, Anthony  stood up and hugged his long lost friend. Anthony invited Ken to stay until he had finished signing  books. Ken did, and the two men grabbed a cup of coffee at a nearby cafe.
 Even though so many years had passed since the two had seen each other, both men had a  lot in common. Both graduated from college with degrees in comparative literature. Both went to  graduate school. Anthony got his Master's of Fine Art in writing. Ken went to law school. Both men  married Mexican women. Both men divorced. Both men also had sons that were only a year  apart. Ken and Anthony decided not to lose touch again. They planned to meet once a month for  breakfast on Saturdays.

210. BOARD GAME NIGHT
 A great American tradition dating back to the birth of the country is the board game night. This  is where two or more families get together at someone's home to have dinner, and refreshments,  and then play games. This is an activity where almost anyone can play. Most board games can be  played by children as young as 6, or 7 years old. It is fun for the kids to test their skills against  their older brothers and sisters, or their parents. One of the oldest and most popular board games  is Monopoly. It is a game where all players start in the same place, and roll dice to advance from  square to square.
 Little Johnny wanted to join the game one night, and asked his parents if he could play.
 "Please, mommy. Please let me play with you tonight," he pleaded. His mom thought about it for a  while, and said, "Okay, Johnny. Tonight you can play." She really didn't think he was going to be  able to play the game, but to her surprise, he was very good at it. The object of the game is to  bankrupt your opponents and have most money at the end of the game. You buy properties with  money collected by moving around the board. The more money you have in your bank, the more  property you can buy.
 Johnny landed on the Boardwalk square, which is a very prized property. It is the most  expensive property, but Johnny knew its value and bought it. The square is positioned at the end  of the game where everyone collects $200, but if you land on it, you have to pay a high rent.
 Johnny bought a couple of nearby properties too, and before long, he was collecting rent from all  the other players. Johnny ended up winning the game, which made him very happy, and it also  made his mom very proud of him. Johnny showed her and everyone else what he was capable of.

211. CELEBRATING A WIN
 The Mexican national soccer team had just won a match against Croatia in the World Cup.
 This meant that Mexico advanced to the next round. Mexican soccer fans worldwide are known  for loyalty to their team. After this win, however, some wonder if they took their loyalty too far.
 In Huntington Park, California, fans took to the street after the win. The afternoon crowd grew  to almost 200 people. The fans waved flags, yelled, honked their cars, and jumped around the  streets. The crowd was so big that they blocked traffic. This caused traffic jams in the area. While  most of these fans were just overzealous, a handful were intoxicated. Instead of just celebrating,  they began throwing bottles. Some of the fans even began rocking cars parked on the streets.
 Police were called to the scene. Not only did the local police department send in patrol cars, two  police helicopters flew overhead and some police on horseback began to try to disperse the  crowd. Someone threw a bottle at a police horse. Police urged shop owners to close their  businesses. The police arrested five people. Thankfully no one was hurt.
 When Mexico played again the following week, police patrolled the streets in advance. This  time they were going to be prepared if Mexico won again. Mexico was playing against the  Netherlands. The Dutch team won 2-1. Mexican fans in Huntington Park still took to the streets  despite the loss. This time the police were waiting in riot gear. The fans waved flags, chanted,  honked horns, rocked cars and even lit firecrackers but no one threw bottles. The police didn't  arrest anyone. They did have to close off three blocks to traffic, though. The police were probably  secretly glad that Mexico didn't win. In four years, when the next World Cup happens, they'll worry  about it again.

212. HAVE POINTS, WILL TRAVEL
 Carla moved to San Francisco two years ago. All of her family was in Boston. Every year she  tried to visit her family twice. She would go once in the summer and once during the Christmas  holiday. Traveling cross-country was expensive though. She needed to find a way to save money  on her travel. She decided to try and use an airline loyalty program to see if that would help.
 There was one airline that Carla preferred to travel on. Every time she used that airline, there  were hardly any delays and the trip was always comfortable. That airline featured in-seat  DIRECTV, so she could watch her favorite television shows while traveling. She could also order  food and beverages right from her seat. An extra perk was that each seat had an electric outlet.
 This made it easy for Carla to plug in her computer and do work on her trip.
 On her last trip, Carla decided to sign up for that airline's loyalty program. She would earn  points for every trip she made. Those points could be used towards air travel. The airline worker  informed Carla that she could earn even more points if she signed up for the airline sponsored  credit card. The card had a low interest rate and no annual fee. For every dollar Carla spent, she  would earn one point to use towards travel. Carla signed up for the credit card. She had good  credit, so she was approved. Carla used that credit card to pay for a round-trip ticket to Boston.
 After only one trip, Carla had earned enough points for a free one-way ticket. That saved her  almost $500. It felt like traveling for free. Carla decided to stay loyal to this airline.

213. LONG DISTANCE RELATIONSHIP
 Marie and Mark have been dating for four months. The relationship is moving fast. They  already are talking about a future together including moving in together. For Marie this means  moving her two children from a previous marriage as well. Marie's children call Mark "daddy".
 Marie and Mark "see" each other almost every day and yet they have never actually met.
 Marie lives in the city of Terrace and Mark lives is Houston. They began conversing with each  other in an online chatroom. How they see each other is through video chat programs like Skype.
 They are constantly texting one another and sending one another pictures.
 Marie asks her friend Bella for advice. Bella met her husband Dan on Twitter four years ago  and moved from New York City to Los Angeles to be with him. It was different from Marie and  Mark's situation, though.
 Bella and Dan had friends in common, even though they lived on opposite coasts of the  United States. Bella also traveled to Los Angeles a number of times to decide if she really liked  Dan and if she could live in another city. Dan and Bella traveled back and forth for over a year  before deciding to move in with another and make a life together. Bella, like Marie, has two  children from a previous marriage. Bella's kids do not call Dan "daddy" though.
 Bella warns Marie not to get in too deep. She tells Marie that Mark needs to come and visit  Los Angeles. Marie can also go to Houston. Bella feels that you really cannot be in a relationship  with someone you only know through the computer. There have even been cases of people being  tricked and not being who they say they are. Marie is infatuated though. She and Mark have  started talking about the kind of house they will buy together in Houston.

214. SUMMER SCHOOL
 It was the first week of June. Gabi just finished her third year of high school in El Sereno.
 However, when she received her report card in the mail, she learned that she failed a semester of  algebra. This meant she had to go to summer school.
 Gabi was glad she had the chance to make up the class. She can't move on to the next level  in math if she doesn't pass algebra. Summer school isn't easy though. Gabi has to master the  material in 6 weeks instead of the 20 she had during the regular school year.
 Summer school also meant that Gabi would be stuck in a hot classroom while most of her  friends were at the beach or local amusement parks. Her friends passed algebra, so they had  most of June, July, and August free from school work. Going to summer school also meant that  Gabi's family had to change their summer vacation plans.
 Gabi had to be in summer school from 9 a.m. to noon. She couldn't stay up late on  weeknights or sleep in. She had to be on the bus at least an hour before class started or else she  would be late. The classrooms were hot since the school building was old and did not have air  conditioning. When Gabi came home from school, she couldn't do whatever she wanted. After  Gabi took the bus home from school, she had homework to do.
 This was the first time Gabi had to go to summer school. She wanted it to be the last time.
 Gabi made a promise to herself. In the fall, when regular classes begin again, she will try her  hardest to pass. Sweating in a classroom while your friends are out having a good time is not fun.
 Summer break is not so much of a break when you have school.

215. AT FATHER'S DAY
 Francesca picked up her seven-year-old son from school one afternoon. Isaac proudly  showed his mother what he had made at school that day. It was a card made out of brightly  colored construction paper. "It's for Father's Day," Isaac explained. The card was cut into the  shape of a man's dress shirt with a drawing of a man's dress tie. Inside the card, Isaac had written  the words "Happy Father's Day."  Francesca wasn't familiar with Father's Day as it wasn't something celebrated in her home  country. So she asked her neighbor Genny about it. Genny told her that Father's Day, like  Mother's Day, is a made up holiday in the United States. It is always celebrated on the second  Sunday in June. People give fathers cards, presents, go out to eat at a restaurant, or do  something special that day. "It's a day to show gratitude to your father," Genny explained.
 Francesca understood, but she also felt a little bad. While the Father's Day card Isaac made  was nice, Isaac's father never wore a dress shirt or a tie. Isaac's father, Tim, wore a uniform to  work. On his days off, he liked to dress casually and comfortably. The most dressed up he got was  by wearing a polo shirt.
 Francesca had an idea. She went shopping the day before Father's Day to get her husband a  surprise. On Father's Day morning, she and Isaac gave Tim a box wrapped up in nice paper.
 "Happy Father's Day," Francesca and Tim shouted.
 When Tim unwrapped the box, he laughed. Inside the box was the Father's Day card Isaac  made in school. Also inside the box were a dress shirt and a tie. They were the same color as the  card Isaac made. Tim, Francesca, and Isaac went next door to Genny's house for a barbecue.
 Tim wore the dress shirt and tie.

216. BLACK FRIDAY
 It was the morning after Julia's first Thanksgiving in the United States. The night before, she  had a huge dinner with her friend Elizabeth's family. Before eating roast turkey, sweet potatoes,  and cranberry sauce, each person at the table had to say something they were grateful for. Julia  appreciated that she was able to participate in this holiday that recalls the Pilgrims' first harvest  after arriving from England a long time ago.
 Julia's phone rang at four in the morning. It was Elizabeth. Elizabeth invited Julia to go  shopping with her. "We are going to the stores so early?" Julia asked sleepily. Elizabeth explained  that the day after Thanksgiving in the United States was called Black Friday. Stores, which held  special sales, started very early. "It's the official start of the holiday shopping season," Elizabeth  explained.
 Julia and Elizabeth were outside the local shopping center by five in the morning. Julia was  surprised to see that not only were all the stores open, but they were crowded. Elizabeth told Julia  that this was nothing. Some people camped outside the mall all night so that they could be among  the first to enter and get extra special deals called "door busters". Many times these "door  busters" were electronic items at extremely reduced prices. Often only a small number of these  items are made available. Sometimes they are only available to the first 100 people in line.
 Julia thought it sounded violent and wondered aloud if people really broke down doors to get  into the store. "Sometimes there is a lot of pushing," Elizabeth explained. Some people have even  been hurt, or killed, because of physical fights over limited products. At 5 a.m. though, the door  busters were gone and the cash registers had long lines. Many shoppers had full shopping carts  of presents they intended to give away for Christmas, Hanukkah, or Kwanzaa.

217. ELECTION DAY
 Ken received many reminders in the mail in the weeks leading up to the first Tuesday in  November, Election Day. From before the time he became a United States citizen, he looked  forward to being able to choose who would represent him in the various levels of government.
 Shortly after taking the citizenship oath, Ken filled out a short paper form, registering him to vote  and choosing a political party affiliation. Ken appreciated that choosing a specific political party  didn't limit whom he could vote for, though. He was free to vote for someone of the party he  registered under. He could even vote for someone of a different party. Since his vote was secret,  no one would know anyway.
 Now that he was a naturalized citizen, Ken spent many hours looking over the various voter  guides that appeared in his mailbox. On the national level, Ken could vote for president, members  of the Congress. On the state level, Ken could vote for state congress people and governor of the  state. Locally, Ken could cast a vote for mayor, city council persons, and local school board  members.
 He felt a little overwhelmed by the choices. Besides getting mail about the various candidates,  he saw many commercials featuring each candidate's position on various issues. There were also  televised debate, which helped show what the candidates have in common and how they differ.
 Ken was nervous on the day he went to vote. He went to his local polling place. A poll worker  asked for Ken's name and address to verify he was registered. Ken confirmed his registration by  signing next to his name. Then he was given a ballot and led to a booth where he had to make  some tough choices.

218. PROM NIGHT
 Callie noticed that her son Jesus, a high school senior, was acting very strangely. He seemed  to be hoarding his allowance and having many whispery conversations with his friends. When  Callie asked Jesus about it, he admitted that he was nervous about prom, a dance held at the end  of senior year of high school for those graduating. Jesus was feeling a lot of pressure to ask a girl  to be his date for the prom. Girls, like Lexi, were also feeling pressure about a guy they liked  asking to the prom. A photographer would be on hand to capture on film forever who said yes.
 Then there was the matter of the clothes. Young men like Jesus didn't have to worry so much.
 Most of them would just rent tuxedos. Young women, like Lexi, however, had to make sure that  whatever dress they wore would be unique. There is nothing more embarrassing than going to the  prom and having another girl wearing the same dress.
 For the parents, like Callie, one of the biggest stressor was money. Tickets to the prom cost  $120 per student. Renting tuxedos cost a lot of money. Not to mention the fact that traditionally he  had to buy his date a corsage. Most students split the cost of a limousine among friends.
 Callie had more than money on her mind, though. She had heard stories about wild things  happening on prom night. She worried about Jesus drinking alcohol, even though he was  underage.
 Callie encouraged her son not to worry so much about finding a date. Maybe he could go to  prom with a group of friends. That was what Jesus ended up doing. It was fine until it was time to  be photographed. All of Jesus's friends split up into couples. Jesus posed alone.

219. NEED TO LEARN HOW TO DRIVE
 Meryl was a little embarrassed to admit it. She was 37 years old, and didn't know how to drive.
 When she lived in Queens, it wasn't such a big deal. Everything that she needed was close by.
 The supermarket was one block away. She would take her shopping cart and get what she  needed for the week easily. When she didn't feel like dragging the shopping cart, the supermarket  even delivered for free. All she had to do was tip the driver. She would use that same shopping  cart to take clothes to and from the laundromat, which was only a block away. While Meryl's job  was not a block away, the subway station was. Every day she would walk the block to catch a 45 minute underground train ride to work. She repeated the journey in reverse to return home in the  evenings.
 Alhambra sure was different, though. The walk from Meryl's house to the supermarket was  nearly a mile. She didn't feel like walking that long a distance while pushing shopping cart full of a  week's worth of food. The laundromat was a mile in the other direction. She wasn't going to push  her dirty clothes through that many streets. There were no trains nearby to take her to work, just  buses. The buses always took a long time to come. For the first few weeks, Meryl was always late  everywhere. Sometimes when she had an urgent appointment, Meryl would ask friends to give  her a ride somewhere. Almost all of her friends had cars and knew how to drive. Most of them  learned it when they were in high school.
 After a while, her friends were tired of giving Meryl rides everywhere. "You need to learn how  to drive, Meryl," they told her. She knew they were right, but Meryl was scared.

220. T-BALL
 Emma's son Johnny had been bugging her about joining a sports team like all his friends. One  day she took Johnny to the local recreational center, where they were having tryouts for baseball.
 She found out about the tryouts from a banner she saw hanging outside the recreation center  when she was driving by. Baseball seemed like the perfect sport for Johnny to learn to play since  it is nicknamed America's Pastime.
 Emma took her son to the tryouts after school. "I'm sorry," one of the coaches told Emma.
 "Johnny was too young to try out for baseball. Since he was six years old, he could try out for T ball, though."  T-ball is similar to baseball except that there is no pitcher. Instead the ball is placed on a stand  called a "T" because of its shape. This makes it easier for younger kids to hit. T-ball games are  also shorter than regular baseball games. Regular baseball games last nine innings. Emma  couldn't imagine her son standing still for nine minutes.
 T-ball sounded like a good way to introduce her son to the responsibilities of being on a sports  team and the rules of baseball. Emma had to bring Johnny back on a different day to try out for T ball. When she did, he was put on a team. After paying a fee, Johnny was given a uniform. Johnny  looked at the back of his uniform. "Hey, look! Mom. I'm number one!" he said proudly.
 Once Johnny started playing though, it was clear to Emma that he was not very good at  baseball. He stuck with it though, and his team ended the season in fourth place. There were only  four teams in the T-ball league. "Can I play again next season," Johnny asked his mom. "Yes, but  see if you can get another number," she told him.

221. A BREATH OF FRESH AIR
 Sam was so proud of himself. He had gone two years without smoking a cigarette. At the age  of 14, Sam was already puffing away on his favorite brand of cigarettes, Marlboro. Even though  people have to be over the age of 18 in America to buy cigarettes, Sam knew of a few stores that  sold cigarettes without checking identification. Sam had spent seven years smoking, he was 21  when he decided to quit.
 Sam decided to quit after discovering he had been coughing blood. He would get tired quickly,  and he noticed his teeth were getting really yellow. Whenever Sam would hang out with his friends  that smoked, he would always want a cigarette really badly, but was always strong and said no  when they offered him one. Before Sam quit, he would go through a pack of cigarettes a week.
 The pack of cigarettes usually cost him $5.25.
 As a way to encourage himself to stop smoking, Sam decided to save his money every week.
 After two years, Sam took out all his money he had saved from not smoking, and saw that he had  saved $504. He decided to buy a bicycle so he could ride it for fun and for exercise. As he started  riding his bike more frequently, he noticed that he didn't think about smoking anymore. He didn't  want a cigarette when he would hang out with his friends that smoked.
 Sam would ride his bike in the morning because he loved getting a breath of fresh air. In the  past when he smoked, the only time he got a breath of fresh air was when he went out for a  cigarette. He enjoyed being outside breathing in the air that would hit his face as he rode his bike  through the town.

222. FALLING INTO A DREAM
 Music had always played a big role in Jonathan's life. He liked different types of music, from  Hip-Hop to Rock 'n' Roll. One of his favorite bands was The Beatles. He could hear them every  day. Jonathan didn't feel that way towards any other band. He had all of their albums, and he  knew all the lyrics to their songs.
 One day, Jonathan and his girlfriend Sarah went for a ride in Jonathan's car. Sarah was  excited to show Jonathan a new band she had heard about. Sarah brought the CD and played it  for Jonathan as they drove around town. The first song was called 40 Day Dream, and the band's  name was Edward Sharpe and The Magnetic Zeroes. Jonathan didn't think much of them at first,  maybe because he was driving, but after they stopped driving, he had the song stuck in his head.
 Jonathan decided to look for their albums. They had three out, so Jonathan decided to buy  them all. During a rainy day, Jonathan invited Sarah to his house and they listened to all three of  their albums. Jonathan loved the band. He loved how they sounded like bands from the past. He  loved how they reminded him of The Beatles.
 When he and Sarah were listening to the third album, the song If I were Free came on.
 Jonathan jumped off his bed and started dancing alone. Sarah looked at him, smiled, and  laughed. Jonathan started clapping, and then he started singing. "The light became too heavy,  and I fell into a dream," he sang. He fell next to Sarah, looked at her and said, "I feel like I'm in a  dream when I listen to this band. Thank you for introducing me to them.

223. STOP AND FRISK
 The night was calm in Los Angeles, although the wind was particularly chilly. Frank had gotten  out of work in Downtown Los Angeles around 11 p.m. He got his sweater, put his headphones on  to listen to music, and put his backpack on. Frank liked taking his backpack to work, because he  could take a change of clothes to work, so that he didn't have to wear his uniform after he got out.
 In order to get to his house, Frank had to take a bus and a train, but he didn't mind because he  could listen to music.
 After getting off the train, Frank got something to eat at a little restaurant that stayed open late  and served hamburgers. After eating, Frank still had to walk for 30 minutes. While Frank was  walking through a small street with a lot of homes, he noticed there was a car behind him  following him slowly. He looked back and noticed it was a police car. He didn't mind because he  wasn't doing anything illegal, so he kept walking.
 As Frank was about to get home, the police car turned on the lights and drove directly to  where Frank was at. They stopped and got out of the car. The two police officers surrounded  Frank. Frank was used to this, and put his hands in the air. The police officers told him to put his  hands on the hood, which he did.
 As Frank was being searched, he asked the police officers why he was being searched. They  ignored him and asked him questions. "Do you have anything illegal on you? Have you been  arrested before? Do you have a weapon?" Frank answered "no," to all of their questions. They put  Frank in the back of the police car. Frank asked again, why he was being searched. One officer  said, "Because you are walking around the neighborhood with a hooded sweatshirt." Frank had  done nothing wrong, so the police let him go after searching his backpack.

224. AN EARTHQUAKE
 Jacquelyn and her family were sleeping in their home. Their dog Scruffy was asleep next to  Jacquelyn. It was 4:36 a.m. and the night was quiet. There were no cars passing in the street, no  noise could be heard, it was like everything was still. Jacquelyn always put a cup with water next  to her bed, so that if she got thirsty during the night she didn't have to walk all the way to the  kitchen. That was when it happened. The furniture started shaking, and the cup of water fell to the  floor. Scruffy started barking and it woke up Jacquelyn. She looked around and saw that all her  stuff was shaking. She started screaming. Soon after, her father came in and told her to come out  quick.
 It was an earthquake. Jacquelyn was so scared, and couldn't move. Her father went in and  picked her up. He took her outside, where Jacquelyn's mother and brother were at already.
 Jacquelyn and her brother were crying. They didn't understand what was happening.
 Luckily, Jacquelyn's mother had prepared an emergency kit and had it outside. She looked for  the key, which was hidden inside a fake rock, and unlocked the box. She pulled out blankets to  keep her children warm. Jacquelyn looked at her mother and took the blanket. She then saw her  dad take a flashlight from the box. He used the flashlight to see if the house had any damage. The  father knew the house was not safe, so they stayed up until someone could examine the house.
 The children didn't have school due to the earthquake, so they spent the day with their  parents. Jacquelyn was so proud of her parents, because they knew what to do during this  disaster. She talked to her friends, and they weren't so lucky. Jacquelyn went up to her mother  and father and hugged them, because she knew she felt the protection of her parents.

225. A REAL GUITAR HERO
 Albert had been playing the guitar almost all his life. His first guitar was given to him by his  father. It was a Fender Stratocaster, and Albert absolutely loved it. As a young boy, Albert would  spend hours and hours listening to songs trying to learn them on his guitar.
 As he grew older, he didn't play the guitar as much. He met a girl and they started dating.
 Eventually they had a son. Every once in a while, Albert would take out the old Fender  Stratocaster and play a song for his baby son named Max. He loved playing guitar for Max,  because it would calm him down when he started crying. As Max got older, he started listening to  the same kind of music his father listened to.
 Albert and his son would listen to music together and talk about what they thought the songs  meant. During Max's tenth birthday, Albert gave his son a Fender Stratocaster as well. The same  model his father had gotten him. It cost him a bit more, but he wanted his son to have the same  one as his. Max was happy, he asked his dad to teach him all the songs he knew. Albert smiled  and said, "Of course!"  When Max turned 17, he joined a band. They played local shows and were able to record  some songs by themselves. One day as Max was walking home from band practice, someone  stopped him and took away his guitar. He was devastated. He went home and locked himself in  his room. He couldn't face his dad. He knew he had let him down. When it was time for dinner,  Max opened his bedroom door and saw his dad's Fender Stratocaster on the guitar stand. There  was a letter and a set of keys on the guitar. The letter said "To my guitar hero, Max. Here is my  guitar, you need it more than I do, and the key to your new car, so nothing like this will happen to  you again."

226. AN OVERTURNED SCHOOL BUS
 A school bus transporting Maxwell High School students overturned on the corner of Seally  Street and Wilten Avenue. The driver of the bus was trying to avoid hitting a car that passed a red  light, and the bus overturned with 37 students inside. The driver suffered minor injuries to the face,  and two students broke their arms.
 Roger Peterson, Principal of Maxwell High School, said that the driver was not at fault. His  reaction helped prevent any serious injuries. As soon as the bus overturned, the driver opened the  door using the emergency handle and started evacuating the students one by one. He notified the  police of the students that were injured.
 "We teach our drivers to ensure the safety of the students first," Peterson said. The driver,  whose name is not being released at the moment due to an investigation, along with the two  students are being treated at Belmont Hospital. The parents were notified as soon as possible by  school officials.
 According to John Pineda, who witnessed the accident, the school bus almost hit the car. "The  bus wasn't going that fast, but the other car was. If the bus had hit the car, those people inside  would surely have been seriously injured, or worse," Pineda said. Pineda also said that the driver  of the school bus took precaution to turn where people weren't walking. If he were to have made a  right, rather than a left, he would have definitely hit people that were crossing the street.
 Peterson issued a statement saying that the students who were inside the bus could miss  school the next day to make sure they were okay, and relax with their family. According to  Peterson, the police provided him with a list of students that were involved in the accident. Police  are looking for the driver of the car that passed the red light. It was a white Honda Civic.

227. CALM AND RELAXED
 Anthony was a senior at high school and had a car. Even though Anthony wasn't 21, which is  the legal age to buy alcohol, he would occasionally have a drink with his friends. Anthony was  excited, because today was his prom day. He had his tuxedo on, and had a flower for his date. He  got into his car and went to pick up his friend Jacob, and then to pick up Jennifer, his date.
 When they showed up to the prom, Jacob's date and Jennifer went to the restroom. Jacob  took out a small bottle of whiskey from his jacket pocket and told Anthony to take a drink. Anthony  took some and didn't like it, but he still drank. As Anthony and Jennifer danced, he began to feel  dizzy. He was drunk. "Anthony, are you okay?" Jennifer asked. Anthony looked at her and  laughed. She figured out that he was drunk, and decided to leave with Jacob's date.
 Anthony got mad and decided to leave. He got in his car and left. As he was driving down  Mentel Avenue, he saw a police car following him. He got nervous and started chewing gum.
 Anthony was looking at the police car through his mirror so much that he almost took a red light.
 When the police saw this, he stopped Anthony.
 The police gave him a few tests to see if he had been drinking, and Anthony failed them. The  police took him away. His father picked him up and they went to talk to a lawyer. The lawyer said  that Anthony would have to take alcohol education classes, go to Alcoholics Anonymous, do  community service, and pay a fine. Anthony's father said that Anthony would have to get a job as  well to pay for the fine. Anthony decided never to drink after that. He said that it wasn't worth it.

228. A DAY AT THE LIBRARY
 Claudette's dad didn't let her have a boyfriend. He told her that 12-year-olds aren't supposed  to have boyfriends. Claudette always wanted a boyfriend, but didn't want to get her dad mad. She  would always go to the library after school to study and wait for her dad to pick her up. One day, a  boy named Steven decided to go up to Claudette and say hi.
 "Hello, my name is Steven. I've seen you here before," he said. "Oh, hello. My name is  Claudette. I always come here to study and wait for my dad. I live a bit far," she said.
 Steven asked Claudette if he could sit with her, so he didn't have to study alone. Claudette  said yes. They started studying and started talking. Soon they weren't studying at all. They began  talking about music, books, movies, and what they liked to do for fun. Steven had to leave before  Claudette's dad came to pick her up, and he asked her if she would be back tomorrow, so that  they could study together again. Claudette said yes.
 The next day, Steven showed up and saw Claudette. He sat down and she smiled at him and  said hello. They began talking about their classes, and what they were learning at school. After  they talked for an hour, Claudette told him she had to go look for a book, and if he could go with  her. Steven agreed, and went to look for the book with Claudette.
 As they were looking for the book, Claudette was in one aisle and Steven was in another.
 Claudette took out a book and saw Steven was looking at her. She smiled and he told her she  was beautiful. She was happy he said that, because she really liked him. Claudette asked him if  he wanted to be her boyfriend. Steven said yes. As they were hugging, Claudette's dad came in  and saw them. He split them up and took Claudette by the hand. He told Steven that he wouldn't  be able to see her again. Steven was sad.

229. PLAYING CATCH
 My big brother James has always been a good baseball player. He is six years older than me,  but he always invites me to go play catch with him. It's one of my favorite things to do. We live  next to a park. Whenever we get bored we just cross the street and start throwing the ball around.
 The last time we went to the park, we were playing catch and also hitting some baseballs with our  bats. Some guys came up to us because they wanted to play a game of baseball. They needed  two more players, so they asked us to play with them.
 James asked me if I wanted to play, and I said yes. The guy's name was Christian, and he  introduced us to all the guys. James introduced me and gave the guy our names. I asked  Christian if I could play catcher. I always liked playing catcher at school. He said that I could and  James got first base. During the game, James got a homerun and I was excited for him. I got on  the base twice, but I got out all the time. I was sad, but James told me not to worry and that it  happens.
 After the game, Christian and the guys told James if he wanted to go grab a drink with them. I  thought James was going to go because he likes to drink, but he told them that he was going to  take me out to eat. We thanked them for the game and Christian asked James for his phone  number just in case they ever needed more players for a game. James gave it to him and then we  went to go eat at Jim's Burgers.
 I asked James why he didn't go to drink with the guys. He told me that he knew his  responsibilities. I didn't know what he meant, but I was glad he didn't go. Now, we could eat  burgers and fries.

230. THE HUMOR IN LIFE
 George had always been a funny guy. I met him at the movie theater. I went to see the new  Spider-Man movie, and he was there dressed up like Spider-Man. He was acting like Spider-Man,  and everyone was clapping for him and asking him for pictures. My girlfriend wanted to go take  her picture with him, and I said okay. When I went up to him, I asked him if it was okay to take a  picture of him and my girlfriend. He said yes.
 I took the picture and started talking to him. He told me that his friends hadn't showed up yet,  and that he didn't want to sit alone. My girlfriend and I decided to sit with him. After we saw the  movie, I asked him if he wanted to go grab a bite to eat. He accepted my invitation. He had me  and my girlfriend laughing the whole drive to the restaurant. We talked a lot on the phone. We  were big fan of Nintendo games. I invited him over to my house so we could play.
 George never had a bad thing to say about anyone. He told me once that there is good in  everyone, some are just afraid to show it. George had invited me to his house one day to play old  Nintendo games, but when I showed up to his house, no one was there. I looked around and  called him on his cell phone, but no one answered. I decided to leave and come back in an hour.
 When I got back to George's house, I saw that someone was inside. I knocked on the door,  and an older woman came out. It was George's aunt. I asked her if George was home, she looked  at me with sad eyes and said that George was in the hospital. I finally understood why George  was the way he was. George had cancer, and the doctors told him that he could go at any time.
 That's why George was always looking for the humor in life, because his real life was filled with  sadness.

231. HOW JOHNNY MET HIS WIFE
 Johnny has always loved taking long walks. He lived close to Griffith Park in Los Angeles. The  park is very beautiful. It has trees and winding roads leading up to the hills where he could get lost  for hours. Whenever he hiked up there, he always felt at peace with the world and with himself. It  was his personal safe zone.
 One day Johnny was hiking up a trail that he had not tried before, and soon he was lost.
 Griffith Park is very large and people have been lost up there in the past, but he knew he would  find a way back. After about an hour of walking around in circles, Johnny heard something move  in the bushes. It scared him for a second, but he just kept walking.
 It was starting to get dark and he began thinking that he might have to spend the night in a  cave or under a rock or something. That was when he heard more noise coming from the trail. It  was very loud. "Hey!" Johnny shouted. "What's out there? Stay away!" He was sure it was a  coyote or maybe a mountain lion. He started looking for something to fight back with in case of an  attack. Johnny was in a full-panic and started shaking uncontrollably as the noise got closer and  closer. Just as he thought that an animal was going to jump out of the bushes, he saw the most  beautiful girl he had ever seen in his life. She was tall and blonde and had long straight hair and  the first thing she said was "Are you okay?"  It turned out her name was Sheila, and she was a park ranger. She told Johnny that she had  seen him walk up the trail earlier, but did not see him come back down, so she decided to come  up to see if everything was okay. Johnny had never been so embarrassed in his life, but that was  okay. The couple ended up getting married a little more than a year after that. She saved Johnny's  life that day, in more ways than one.

232. MY BIKE CLUB
 I had the most wonderful childhood. I grew up in San Diego, where it rains about two days a  year, and it's always sunny and bright. I could ride my bike just about any day of the year, and had  lots of friends. My best friend was George Kenny. George lived just a few houses down the block  from me and we were the same age. Actually, I was about 28 days older than him, a fact that I  always threw in his face. "You must respect your elders," I would sometimes tell him. That usually  got a nasty response from him. Anyway, George came up to me one day and said, "Hey Richard,  why don't we form a bicycle club?"  I thought about it for a while, and then he said, "We could give ourselves a cool name and get  hats and stickers and have lots of fun. What do you say?" I immediately fell in love with the idea.
 "You bet, Georgie Porgy!" I used to call him that all the time even though I knew he hated it. Well  before we knew it, we got a couple of other guys together and came up with the best name for a  club ever. We were the "White Skulls." Why we chose that name, I'll never know, but all the kids  seemed to like it, so I was okay with it, too.
 The four of us went to the local bike shop and we each picked out a skull decal to put on our  bikes. I chose a green one, while Georgie Porgy picked red. He shouted: "I am the red skull! I am  the king of the club! If you don't like it, try to take it from me!" George was a pretty big guy, so no  one argued with him. We rode our bikes everywhere and had a great summer. That's how we  formed the greatest bike club ever!

233. HELEN THE GARDNER
 Helen was outside watering her lawn like she does every other day. She loves her lawn and  her garden. She has the prettiest house on the block, but it's only because she works at it very  hard. Helen is in her mid-40s but you wouldn't know it by looking at her. Her face is nearly wrinkle free, and it seems she has more energy than people half her age.
 "Good morning, Helen." I said as I walked outside on my way to work. "Hi Robert, how are  you?" she asked. "Fine! I'm doing fine. Your yard is looking good," I said. And it was. Sometimes it  really bothers me that I can't get my lawn to look as nice as hers. "What's your secret, Helen?" I  asked. "Secret to what?" She answered. "To having such a beautiful lawn! I water mine, I seed  mine every year and I still can't get it to look as good as yours. I'm jealous!" I said with a smile.
 Helen just nodded and had this funny little look on her face that suggested she was just better at  keeping her lawn nice than I was.
 I didn't like that look, but I guess it's okay that she feels that way. I've known Helen since she  was a little girl and things have not gone well with her lately. She's been alone for a long time. She  wasn't very pretty when she was young. She had terrible acne that covered her face from ear to  ear. It made her very self-conscious so she didn't go out on dates very much, but that all changed  when she met Josh. They were together for more than 10 years until, sadly, they went their  separate ways. Since then, Helen has nurtured and tended her garden as if it were her child.
 When I got home later that day, she was outside working on her roses. I said hello to her as I  walked to my door, and she smiled brightly. She looked beautiful.

234. MY FRIEND DIEGO
 Alex was shopping at the local market yesterday trying to find some fresh vegetables for his  dinner that night. The market is in the neighborhood, and it is not one of the giant, national, big name stores. It is a small store with only a few locations around Los Angeles. Alex likes these  types of markets so much better than the super stores because there are real people running  them.
 Alex knows the guy that runs the fruits and vegetables section at the market. His name is  Diego, who was born in Tijuana, Mexico, about 120 miles from Los Angeles. Diego always lets  Alex know what is a good buy at the market. "Hola Diego," Alex said in Spanish. "Hey Alex, how  are you," he answered in English. This happens every time Alex talks to Diego. Alex speaks to him  in Spanish, and Diego answers in English.
 Spanish is spoken a lot around L.A. The city has the largest population of Mexicans anywhere  in the world, except Mexico City. Alex likes to show Diego how much Spanish he knows, and  Diego also wanted Alex to know how much English he knows. It's so funny to hear a conversation  like this. They sometimes get strange looks from people.
 Today, Diego got some beautiful oranges. They were big and plump, and were at the right  price, too. "These are great, Alex. You will like them very much," said Diego. Alex responded with  "Muy bueno, Diego," which means "Very good, Diego." He also told Alex about some tasty  cucumbers they had today, and Alex ended up buying a few of those too. When Alex left, he said,  "Buenas tardes, Diego," which is a Mexican farewell phrase, and Diego said, "See you soon, my  friend."

235. GOING BACK TO SCHOOL
 Dennis had always been a terrible student. When he was a kid, his parents sent him to a  Catholic school. He didn't know much about the school. Of course he didn't know much about  anything when he was 6 years old, but he did know one thing - all his friends from the  neighborhood went to a public school. Dennis was the only boy that went to a private school, and  his friends would often tease him about it. "You're not one of us! You're not one of us," they would  sometimes chant. He wasn't really alone, though. His friend Patricia also went to the Catholic  school, but she was a girl. After a while, they began walking to the small school together every  morning. Pat was the first girl friend Dennis had ever had. She wasn't his girlfriend. She was just a  friend who happened to be a girl.
 The nuns at the school were very mean. They ruled the school like it was a prison. Dennis  was afraid to even raise his hand to ask a question. His mother was often called into meetings  with the principal about Dennis, who would also sit in the office listening to the principal telling his  mother how smart he was, but was very lazy. Needless to say, Dennis didn't do well in school and  ended up going to a junior college after high school. He didn't do very well there either, and soon  dropped out.
 That all changed after Dennis grew up and started working. He had worked for many years  before deciding he wanted to earn a degree after all. Dennis went back to school at the age of 30,  and soon was a college graduate with a degree. It turned out Dennis wasn't as lazy as those nuns  thought he was.

236. MARIO'S FIRST CAR
 When Mario was 19 years old, he bought his first car. It was a brand-new 1985 Toyota Corolla.
 He was on top of the world! It was beautiful, and was really fast and fun to drive. Living in  Southern California without a car is not a good idea. The region is so spread out that it could take  hours getting from one part of town to another if you use public transportation. You are not anyone  in Los Angeles if you don't have a car, or at least that is what some people say.
 Before that, Mario had never owned or bought a car in his life. His father warned him about  the sales people. "Don't ever pay the asking price, son," he said. Mario looked at him with  disbelief. "What do you take me for, dad? I am not an idiot. I know not to pay the first offer," he  screamed back. His dad offered to go with him to the car dealer, but Mario wanted to go alone. It  was his money and his car, and he was determined to do this alone.
 When Mario got to the car dealer, a nice man came up to him and asked if he wanted to take  the car he was looking at for a test drive. Mario said, "Yes, of course." So they went for a drive.
 Mario fell in love with the car and the salesman knew immediately that he was going to make  some money. It turns out that you should never let a salesman know you're interested in anything  you want to purchase. Mario didn't know how to negotiate and wound up paying too much for the  car. He really didn't care, though. He owned his first car. When he told his dad what he paid for it,  he thought his dad was going to be mad, but he just said, "That's okay, son. That same dealer  ripped me off when I bought my first car, too."

237. JOINING THE MARINE CORP
 Phil grew up in a very poor family in a very poor town. It was pretty bad. Sometimes Phil and  his sisters didn't have enough to eat and went to bed hungry. That was okay with Phil though  because that was his life, and he thought it was just the way everybody in the world lived.
 Phil had a lot of fun and had many friends. It wasn't until Phil was about 12 years old that he  began to realize that there were better things out there in the world. Phil and his best friend Albert  would sit around and talk about getting out of this place to see the world. It was a fantasy, but it  was a good fantasy. They really didn't know how they would do it, but they had a dream. Then one  day Phil's cousin Ralphie came to visit.
 Phil didn't know Ralphie very well. Ralphie grew up in Texas and was about 8 years older than  Phil. It had been years since Phil saw his cousin. That day Ralphie changed Phil's life. Ralphie  walked into the house wearing his Marine Corp uniform, and Phil knew at that moment that he  wanted to become a Marine.
 Phil and Ralphie talked all night long. Ralphie told him all about the Corp and Phil was  fascinated. Ralphie was wearing his medals and awards, and his uniform was so neat and clean  that Phil wanted to join at that moment. Five years later, Phil enlisted in the Marines. He was 17  and needed his mom's permission. His mom said "Where do I sign?" Of course she was joking,  but she knew Phil was going to do this. It was his way out of this place, so she gave him her  blessings. The day Phil left, he promised his mom he would be back. He kept his promise. He  came back several times over the years, and helped his family as much as he could.

238. A WORKAHOLIC DAD
 David must have been the only kid in America that did not like summer vacation. Every year,  between the beginning of June through the end of August, school kids were on vacation. Only to  David, summer vacation meant work, work, and more work! His dad was a workaholic. He had  two jobs most of the time. He had one job during the day and the other at night, but sometimes he  worked on weekends, too. The man had more energy than any persons alive. When he wasn't  working on weekends at his third job, he worked at home and that was why David hated summer  vacation.
 His dad was always building something, or tearing something down. If he wasn't tearing down  a wall, or adding a new room to the house, he was putting in a new driveway or garage. It was  living hell for a 13-year-old kid. While all of David's friends were off playing baseball or riding their  bicycles, he was usually hauling bricks or mixing cement. That's what he remembers about his  childhood.
 David always knew he was in trouble whenever he heard "Where's David!" His dad's voice  seemed to carry down the street. That phrase could only mean it was time to get to work. Of  course David learned throughout the years how to make himself disappear at just the right times,  but his dad usually found him anyway. "But dad, I want to go to the park to play with my friends,"  David would say. "You can waste time with your buddies some other time. It's time to get to work  now," his dad would respond. It got so bad that David would intentionally fail classes so he would  have to go to summer school. Summer school was for students who didn't do well during the  regular school year, but he didn't care. It meant less work. It meant freedom!

239. THE CARNIVAL
 Every June, my old elementary school has a carnival on its ground. This has been happening  since I was a little boy. I used to have so much fun there. It was amazing. It had rides like the  Ferris wheel and the flying teacups. The Ferris wheel was this huge wheel that carried two people  in a giant circle above the rest of the carnival. I remember the first time I got on it when I was 7  years old. I had been begging my mom for months to let me ride it.
 "Please, mom, please. I'm big enough now," I would scream. However, she kept saying,  "You're too young, Billy. Maybe one day." Of course, 7-year-old kids have short memories. I kept  asking over and over again until she finally said okay, but she said she was going with me. "I'm a  big boy, mom. I can go alone," I said. She would not agree. "We're going together, or not at all,"  she said. And of course I said okay.
 When the big day came, I was so excited. I almost had an accident while waiting in line. The  guy who was seating people kept saying "Next" as more and more people got on and the line kept  shrinking. His shouts of "Next" kept getting louder and louder and I knew my time was coming up.
 When we finally reached the end of the line, it felt like I waited a month, we got on and put on our  seat belts. I was excited and afraid at the same time. Then it started.
 I went so high up in the air that I got dizzy. My stomach began to turn, and I felt like throwing  up. It was just too fast and too high for me. I didn't get sick, but I was sure glad I was on the  ground again when I told my mom, "Please don't send me up there again, mom!"

240. HIGH SCHOOL LOVE
 Going to an all-boy high school was no fun. Joe's parents thought it would be a good idea to  send him there instead of a public school because "He would get distracted by girls," as his mom  would say. Once, during his third year, Joe begged his mom to let him go to public school. "I just  want to be normal," he would tell her. "I want to meet girls. I don't want to be weird." But his words  always fell on deaf ears. Mom always said that Joe had plenty of time to go on dates after high  school, and that he needed to concentrate on his school work.
 This usually made him very sad, but like a good kid, Joe just nodded his head and went on  with his studies. That all changed one day when Joe met Carmen, who lived just two blocks away  from him. One day he ran into her at the market by chance. They had gone to kindergarten  together. They were also of the same age. She was in Joe's class, and she remembered Joe, too.
 After about two weeks, they were going steady. Joe was so happy, but had to hide his  relationship from his parents, which was okay because Carmen was hiding him from her family,  too! "Are you kidding me?" Carmen said, "They would kill me if they knew I had a boyfriend!"  Everything was going great for a time, but Joe's mom was right. His grades started slipping, and  he soon was on academic probation because he was spending too much of his free time with  Carmen. She also dropped a grade or two. As a result, both of them had to go to summer school  to improve their grades, but Joe didn't care. He was in love and that was all that mattered at the  time. Much later, he came to realize his mom was right.

241. A HOT SUMMER DAY
 One hot summer day, Jay and his friends were playing outside. The sun shined down on Jay  and his friends as they kicked a soccer ball back and fourth. Soccer was Jay's favorite sport to  play. Almost every day Jay would invite his friends from his neighborhood to come out and play  soccer in the street. Jay dreamed of one day being a professional soccer player. He imagined  shooting a goal and hearing the roar of thousands of people as they cheered his name throughout  the soccer stadium. Jay knew it would require a lot of practice if he wished to make his dream a  reality.
 One day, as the sun was beaming down on the street where Jay and his friends played earlier,  an ice-cream truck approached. As soon as Jay heard the ice-cream truck's music playing, he ran  outside his house with two dollars in his hand. Jay looked around to see where the ice-cream  truck was. As soon as he spotted it down the street he bolted towards it. Jay's friends had arrived  first and were already asking the ice-cream man for a cone of their favorite flavor of ice-cream.
 This gave Jay time to think about what flavor to get. "Should I get chocolate or vanilla?" Jay asked  himself. "What's it going to be, son?" the ice-cream man asked Jay when he noticed he was the  last kid standing without an ice-cream cone. "I'll have Pistachio, please," Jay responded after  some hesitation.
 This summer had turned out to be the best so far for Jay. Tomorrow he would play soccer  once more, and if the ice-cream truck came around, he would ask his parents for another two  dollars. Jay was not looking forward to starting his school year in two weeks.

242. HUNGRY ABEL
 One day, Abel opened his refrigerator and gasped when he noticed there wasn't anything in  there. "Who ate all the food?" Abel asked his brother Mel, who was in the living room sitting down  on the couch watching cartoons. "You probably woke up in the middle of the night and ate it all!"  Mel humorously responded. Abel was not amused. His stomach was growling and he had no time  for Mel's childish quips. "I'm so hungry! I could eat a horse!" Abel proclaimed. "I bet you can easily  eat two," Mel jokingly said. "You are so funny," Abel sarcastically replied.
 Abel thought of ordering a pepperoni pizza by phone, but soon realized he had only five  dollars. He needed ten dollars to make the purchase. He was short by five dollars. Abel asked his  brother if he could pitch in for the rest, but he had no cash. "Are you even hungry?" Abel asked  Mel. "I already ate," Mel said. This made Abel jealous and a bit angry. "What did you eat?" Abel  inquired, with furrowed brows. "A ten-dollar Pizza," Mel casually replied. "You must be kidding,"  Abel said, almost yelling. Mel just sat there watching a recording of an episode from The  Simpsons.
 "When is mom coming back?" Abel asked Mel. "I don't know" he replied. Abel could now only  hope that his mom would come to the rescue and bring a large fresh pizza from Pizza Mountain.
 Abel plopped down next to Mel on the couch and started watching television with him. They both  laughed out loud at the cartoon's funny characters. Abel was enjoying himself so much that he  had forgotten that he was hungry. Then commercials began playing. Abel's stomach started  calling for food again. "I'm going to starve to death," Abel said, as the front door to his house  started opening. "I'm back, and I brought pizza!" Abel's mom said as she came in through the  door. Abel could not wait to get his hands on the pizza.

243. JOEL'S JOB SEARCH
 Joel's school semester was ending soon, but he still had not found a job to keep him busy  over the summer vacation. This wasn't the only reason Joel wanted a job. He had been taking the  bus to school for over a year already. He was ready to start driving to school. All of his friends had  been driving since the age of eighteen, and Joel felt like he was left behind. He had calculated the  math and figured it would take him two months of working for him to be able to afford a used  vehicle, or one month if he worked full time. Joel had it all planned out. The only problem was  finding steady employment.
 Joel felt like he had applied everywhere possible. He had walked into several fast food  restaurants. He had stepped in countless coffee shops. He had visited various retail stores and  supermarkets. Joel went around shaking the hands of managers, introducing himself as a college  student who was interested in working. Joel mingled with employees and talk to frequent  customers, in hopes of getting some recognition or even a piece of advice. After submitting  application after application, it seemed like he would never get hired. Joel felt like giving up hope.
 But then one afternoon, Joel received a call for an interview. Joel jumped for joy when he  discovered the interview was for a job working at a bookstore. Joel was so determined to get the  job that he was hired right after his interview. He had greatly impressed the manager, who felt he  was the perfect candidate for the job. Everything was going according to his plan. Soon he had  enough money saved up to buy the car he had dreamed of.

244. VALERY'S BUS TRIP
 Riding the bus is as easy as pie. The bus driver is there to answer any questions passengers  may have. And it only costs one dollar and fifty cents. These were the things Valery had heard  from all her friends about public transportation. She had never ridden on the bus alone before.
 This was about to change in fifteen minutes as she stood waiting at the bus stop at the corner of  Atlantic Avenue and 61th Street. Valery had just turned fifteen and was ready to start riding the  bus on her own.
 Valery's mom had sent her to Grandma's house for a weekend stay. She had packed all her  belongings in a backpack, and was dressed in her lucky outfit in case she crossed any black cats.
 She was heading to the city of Montebello where her Grandmother lived. Her heart began racing  when she saw the number 260 bus approaching in the distance. She looked around to see if she  was alone, but there wasn't anyone else waiting for the bus. She was all alone.
 "Come on, you can do this," Valery said to herself. She remembered she and her mother had  taken the same bus to her Grandma's house the dozens of times. "It's just like before, except  mom is not here," Valery said, trying to ease herself. The bus finally came to a halt at its stop, and  its doors opened in front of Valery. She took a deep breath, looked at the bus driver, and stepped  inside.
 Valery put the money into the slot and greeted the bus driver. She then proceeded to the back  of the bus and quickly sat down next to an elderly woman. The scariest part was over. "Now all I  have to do is sit and wait until I reached my destination," said Valery to herself. "Don't forget to pull  the cord," a familiar voice said in her head.

245. STUDYING FOR THE BIG TEST
 Monday was the day of the big test. Luella had three days left to study. She knew she had to  study for at least three hours per day in the next couple of days if she hoped to get the grade she  wanted. Luella needed to score at least a ninety percent on her test in order to pass her Algebra  class with an A.
 The stakes were high for Luella. She had attended every lecture this semester. She had jotted  down notes upon notes to take home and study. She had even sat in a few tutoring sessions after  class. After turning in all her homework and passing all her quizzes, Luella still felt like she could  fail her final test. After all, it was cumulative, meaning the test would test her on everything she  had learned.
 Luella knew what she had to do. It was time to buckle down and study like there was no  tomorrow. Motivated and determined, Luella sat at her desk and studied for at least three hours  for the next three days. By the time the night before the test came, Luella felt confident that she  would do well.
 Luella woke up that Monday morning with a grin on her face. She had dreamed of taking the  test. In the dream she passed her test with an A. It was up to Luella to make her dream come true  that Monday morning. Luella was assured she would. She knew all that studying was about to pay  off as she walked into her classroom and sat down at her desk. "Nothing can go wrong," Luella  said to herself.
 She was right! Luella not only breezed through all the math problems, but was the first person  to finish in her class. Luella knew she could do it. It was of no surprise when she discovered the  grade she received. It was an A plus.

246. JENNY'S FIRST PETS (1)
 Jenny had always wanted a pet of her own. She wanted something to take care of, someone  to be there whenever she came back home, and most of all, an animal to be best friends with.
 Jenny would constantly ask her dad to buy her a pet, but her dad always refused. Jenny's dad  knew having a pet was a big responsibility. He did not think Jenny was ready to own a pet at ten  years old, and that was exactly what he told her when she asked for one. "When will I be ready?"  Jenny asked one day. "Wait until you're twelve," Jenny's dad replied. This was good news for  Jenny. All she had to do now was to be patient.
 Two years had passed. Jenny had been counting down the days on her calendar. The  morning of her twelfth birthday, Jenny jumped on her dad's bed and immediately reminded him of  what he had said two years ago. "Have you decided on what pet to get?" Jenny's dad asked.
 Jenny could not respond. She had not made up her mind on what kind of pet she wanted. "Let me  think about it," she said and ran to her room.
 Jenny took into consideration all the pets she could imagine. She imagined a white fluffy cat  that she'd name Tabby or a large bright golden retriever that she'd name Yellow and play Frisbee  with in the afternoons. She imagined owning colorful Macaw that she'd name Polly and have  conversations with whenever she felt lonely. After an hour of weighing in the options, Jenny had  made up her mind.
 Jenny's dad was surprised when he found out what pet his daughter had chosen. "I want a  horse," she declared when she walked back into her dad's bedroom. "How about something a little  less expensive," he said to Jenny. "A pony?" she cleverly replied. "Let's go to the pet shop,"  Jenny's dad said.

247. JENNY'S FIRST PETS (2)
 It was four o'clock when Jenny and her dad arrived at the pet shop on Slauson Avenue. The  name of the pet shop was Pet Wonders. Jenny couldn't contain her excitement and yipped as she  and her dad exited the car. Jenny's dad smiled at the sight of her thrilled daughter. He  remembered his own first pet. It was a Chihuahua named Taco. He wondered if Pet Wonders was  selling any Chihuahuas.
 Jenny and her dad were greeted by a short and balding man, who smelled like dog food.
 "Hello, how can I help you guys today?" the man said. "We're here to buy a pony!" Jenny  exclaimed to the man. "Actually, we're here to browse," Jenny's dad said right after. "Let me know  when you're ready to make a purchase," the man replied. Jenny and her dad proceeded to look  through the aisles.
 "What do you think of these, Jenny?" asked her dad. "They're too small," she said. Jenny saw  a variety of colorful fishes. "What about these, Jenny?" her dad asked. "They're too slimy," said  Jenny. Jenny came across snakes and turtles. "Would you like one of these?" asked her dad. "I  don't think so," Jenny responded. One hour passed and Jenny still had not made up her mind on  which animal to choose.
 Jenny and her dad finally got around to see the cats and dogs. "It's either one or the other,"  Jenny's dad said, pointing to the cats and dogs. Jenny had to think long and hard on which pet to  get. After what seemed like an eternity, Jenny looked up at her dad and said, "I can't choose one".
 Her dad paused for a minute, smiled and said to her, "Then choose two". Jenny went home with a  white cat and a black dog, which were the best birthday present she had ever received.

248. SURFING
 Surfing was Jeffrey's favorite pastime. Every weekend Jeffrey and his best friend Chad would  head to Santa Monica Beach, where they would surf big waves. California was the perfect place  to live if you were a surfer. The sunny sky and nice temperature made it an ideal place for surfing.
 Best of all, California mostly maintains this kind of nice weather throughout the year. Jeffrey and  Chad were grateful to be surfers in California and not in Iceland. While their other friends were  skateboarding and rollerblading, Jeffrey and Chad were at the beach surfing the day away.
 Jeffrey was fifteen years old when he first learned how to surf. Chad was two years younger  when he started learning. They both had met at a surfing competition. Jeffrey was eighteen and  Chad sixteen at the time of the competition. Despite being rivals at first, Jeffery and Chad soon  became buddies after the competition. Now twenty-one and nineteen, Jeffrey and Chad had  become the best surfers on the West Coast. Their medals and trophies were proof of this.
 There wasn't anything more satisfying in the world than surfing the waters as the sun beamed  from above and the wind blew by. Surfing was an exhilarating and incredible experience. It was  also a great stress reliever. Jeffery and Chad felt as if they were on top of the world when surfing.
 Nothing else mattered when you were in the midst of a barrel ride. Jeffery and Chad knew that  surfing for them would be a lifelong passion.
 The beach was a great place to be at. This was especially true in the summer when pretty  girls would gather on the weekends, bonfires would line the shores at night, and vendors and  artists would attract visitors to purchase their wares. There was never a dull moment while at the  beach. But if it wasn't for the waters, Jeffrey and Chad would have no reason to go to the beach.

249. JANE THE LIVING DOLL
 There once was a little living doll. She lived inside a doll house that was placed in the corner  of a little girl's room. The doll's name was Jane, and the little girl's was Diana. Diana and Jane  were best friends. No one else knows that Jane can talk and breathe like anyone else. It was a  secret between Jane and Diana.
 Jane and Diana would play together every day. Sometimes they would play within the doll  house. They liked watching movies, playing hide and seek, and painting. They also liked playing  outside with toy cars and drawing with chalk on the ground. Since Diana was far too big and Jane  far too small, they could not play hide and seek and run over long distances. Instead they enjoyed  playing their own version of hide and seek. When they played, it would have to be inside a small  room. Jane was always the one to hide since it was easy for her to do so.
 One day, it was Diana's birthday, and she had several of classmates from school come over to  celebrate. Jane stayed hidden from plain sight in Diana's room. At one point, things became  rowdy among some of the boys and girls, and they began to chase each other around the house.
 Then a few of them entered Diana's room and began invading her things. One of the boys got a  hold of Jane who was in her doll house and started to toss and play catch with her among the  boys. Then Diana came into the room and took notice of what was happening to Jane and  immediately yelled for them to stop. They put Jane back down. Jane was so frightened but  relieved to be saved.
 "Get out!" Diana screamed. After everybody left, Diana lifted up Jane and asked her if she was  okay. Diana was happy to see that Jane was in one piece. It would be the last time that Diana  would bring anyone over to play. This secret was too great to risk its discovery. Nobody could ever  know of Jane the living doll.

250. AN EMERGENCY
 Amisa was a single mother who worked from home tutoring students. She liked this job  because it allowed her to stay home with her own little daughter Nimisha. Amisa saw all her  clients at her kitchen table. She picked the kitchen table because from there she could watch her  daughter, who usually stayed in the living room. Nimisha usually stayed in the living room when  her mother was working with another student.
 One afternoon though, Nimisha felt so thirsty. She had to get into the kitchen to get a drink.
 "Mom, can I please have a drink?" Nimisha asked. Amisa was annoyed. She was in the middle of  a lesson. "Yes, but you have to serve yourself because I'm working," Amisa said. Nimisha pulled a  stepstool up to the kitchen cabinet and stood on it. She opened the kitchen cabinet and reached  up to the top shelf to get a blue plastic cup. Then she slipped. Nimesha let out a huge scream.
 When Amisa got up to see what was wrong, she saw that her daughter's hand had slipped and  the tongs of a large serving fork had gone through Nimisha's finger. Nimisha was crying. Amisa  was scared. She had her client go home early, and was going to rush her daughter to the hospital.
 She didn't want to try and pull the fork out herself because she was worried that she might make  the situation worse.
 Nimisha lived four blocks from the hospital. She felt it was faster to walk to the hospital than  call and wait for an ambulance. There was only one problem. It was very cold outside, and Amisa  couldn't put a coat on her daughter when she had a huge serving fork protruding from one of her  fingers. Amisa wrapped a blanket around her child and together they quickly walked to the  hospital.
 "My daughter has a fork stuck in her finger!" Amisa yelled as she entered the emergency  room.

251. DISAPPEARANCE OF A LEGO
 Mike was having a beer in the living room one evening while watching a football game. His  five-year-old son Rob was playing with Legos on the floor. "Hey Dad, bet I can make one of these  Legos disappear," Rob told his dad. Mike was only half paying attention to his son since his  favorite team was playing. "Uh huh," Mike absent-mindedly answered. "Tada! I made it  disappear!" Rob said proudly. Mike asked his son what his secret was. "A magician never tells,"  Rob said while tapping his nose. Mike shrugged his shoulders. "Guess, Daddy. Guess!" Rob  encouraged.
 Mike first guessed the Lego was in his son's pocket. He was wrong. Then Mike guessed that  the Lego was in his son's sock. That too was a wrong guess. Mike gave up. "It's in my nose, Dad!"  Rob proudly declared. Mike spit out his beer and rushed to look up his son's nose. He couldn't see  anything up there. He went to the kitchen junk drawer and took out a small flashlight. Mike looked  up his son's nose again. He still couldn't see the bright yellow Lego piece. "Are you sure it's up  there?" Mike asked his son. Rob nodded. "Does it hurt?" Mike asked. Rob shook his head.
 Mike didn't want to stick anything up his son's nose to try and take out the mini toy brick. He  was scared he would push the Lego up higher and hurt his son. "I guess we have to go to the  hospital," Mike told his son. Rob looked scared. It was a short drive to the hospital emergency  room. Mike felt like the most negligent dad in the world when he told the triage nurse the reason  for the visit. "My son has a Lego stuck up his left nostril," Mike said in a low voice.

252. DROUGHT-RESISTANT PLANTS
 Hannah was worried about the plants in her garden. Her state recently declared a drought and  her plants were showing that they missed the rain. Her plants were all dead or dying. Their leaves  were brown and dry. Even the small patch of grass in front of her house was drying up because of  the lack of rain and the overall shortage of water.
 Hannah didn't want to give up on her garden. She loved spending time in her yard. She loved  working with her hands in the dirt. She loved watering the plants and watching, week by week, her  hard work pay off. From a small seed in the soil, she grew flowers and herbs. This season,  though, was a bust.
 She began to do some research on the Internet on drought-resistant plants, which are plants  that would do alright in full sun and without regular water. It turned out there were quite a few  plants that were drought-resistant. Through her Internet search, Hannah even found a website for  a place that was selling native plants, which were grown naturally from her climate.
 Hannah laughed at the name though. It was called a nursery. Hannah always thought a  nursery was a bedroom for a new-born baby or a very young child, not a place to buy plants. The  more she thought about it though, the more it made sense. Going to a nursery was like going to  get a baby. Except in this case, the baby was a plant she would bring home.
 Hannah drove 30 minutes to get to the nursery, which had a whole section of drought-resistant  plants. She walked up and down the outdoor aisles, carefully considering her options. Then she  stopped in front of a small seedling that was just flowering. "I found my baby," she thought.

253. FACEBOOK FRIENDS
 Katherine loved Facebook. With Facebook she could keep in contact with her family no matter  how far away they were. She could see photographs of her cousins and read status updates from  her aunts and uncles. With Facebook she could keep her relatives up to date on what she was  doing. With a few taps on the keyboard and hitting the send button, she could tell a dozen or more  people about her new job. She could also send pictures so that they wouldn't worry that she  wasn't eating enough or was unhealthy.
 Another thing Katherine loved about Facebook was that she didn't have to think about time  zones when updating family. Whenever she called her parents or other relatives, she always had  to think about the time difference so that she wouldn't wake someone up or call when she knew  they were at church. Facebook was so convenient.
 Another thing happened when Katherine joined Facebook though. Some people she went to  high school with started to add her as a friend. At first, this didn't bother her. She loved learning  about the success of people she knew when she was just a teenager. She loved finding out  people were getting married, having babies, and traveling.
 Soon however, Katherine found herself comparing herself to the people she was reading  about on Facebook. It began to make her feel bad that some people seemed to be doing so much  better than she was. They had better jobs, nicer clothes, and cuter boyfriends. She was also  spending a lot of time on Facebook. It took a lot of time and energy to keep up with everyone's  status updates.
 Katherine started to think. She looked at the list of over 500 friends she had on Facebook and  realized some of them were not really friends at all.

254. SERVICE ANIMALS
 Jose Luis was taking the train to work one day when he noticed a woman with a big German  Shepard getting on the train. This made him nervous. What if that dog attacked someone? Jose  Luis didn't know that people could bring pets with them onto trains. It seemed unsafe. He stepped  closer to the dog. The German Shepard seemed friendly enough. Just as he put out his hand to  pet the dog, the woman stopped him.
 "Please don't pet him. He's working," the lady told him. Jose Luis didn't understand. The  woman explained that she was blind and that the dog Hampton acted as her eyes, helping her  navigate her way around the city. The woman pointed out the special vest that Hampton was  wearing. The vest was printed with the words "service animal".
 Jose Luis had never heard of service animals before. "Service animals like Hampton are  allowed into public places that most pets are not. Hampton is more than a pet. He helps me be  self-sufficient and do the things that I need to do in the city," the woman explained. The woman  also told Jose Luis that service animals had to go through special training so that they learn how  to behave in public places and do not get distracted. "People need to help too though, by not  petting him," the woman added.
 The woman continued to explain that service animals do not just help the blind. Some animals  act as therapy animals. Therapy animals go into hospitals and nursing homes. These animals  lower the stress levels of people who are very sick or who have just had operations. They also  encourage people to recover. Therapy animals are especially popular in children's hospitals. Dogs  really can be man's best friends.

255. UNDERGROUND MUSIC
 Michelle was tired after a long day at work. She just wanted to get home, order a pizza for  dinner, and go to bed. As she sat on the train home, she closed her eyes. Suddenly she heard  music. It was a harmonica playing a sad song. It sounded like a blues song. She opened her eyes  to look where the sound was coming from. Was it from someone's iPod with the volume up loud?
 The sound was coming from a man leaning against the subway doors playing a harmonica.
 When he finished playing the song he walked up and down the aisles with a cup in his hand  asking for tips. Michelle didn't feel like this was fair. While the music wasn't unpleasant, it's not like  she had a choice. She was forced to listen to it since she has to take the train home from work.
 Now he was asking to be paid by the people being forced to listen? He had some nerve. Michelle  didn't give the man any money. Some of her fellow commuters did drop a few coins in the man's  cup.
 "You shouldn't encourage that," Michelle told one of her fellow commuters after he dropped  some change in the man's cup. "I don't even think it's legal for him to play music in the train and  ask for money," Michelle said. She then scanned the advertisements and notices inside the train  car. Sure enough she found a sign that said playing music and soliciting was not allowed and that  there would be a fine for people caught by the police.
 When the harmonica player passed by Michelle and extended his cup out so he could put in  some change, she pointed to the sign. The harmonica player shrugged his shoulders. "We all  have to make a living, lady," he said.

256. SUMMER PROGRAMS FOR KIDS
 School was over for the year. This meant that the school's after-school program, which kept  Adriana's daughter June in school until she was done with work, was also over. The after-school  program was convenient because June didn't have to leave the school. Adriana didn't have to  worry about her daughter being home alone. The after-school program also made sure that June  did her homework. This made Adriana's job as a single mother so much easier. All she had to  worry about when she picked her daughter up from school was dinner.
 One of the best things about the after-school program was the cost. It only cost 30 dollars a  month. The school did not offer a summer program. Adriana did not have a summer vacation from  work so she needed to find a program that would watch June while she was working. Hiring a  private babysitter was too expensive.
 Another mom from June's school gave Adriana information about a local recreational center  that was offering a summer program for school-age kids. The program was not as expensive as  other summer camp programs, but was more expensive than after-school cost though. The  summer program cost 50 dollars per week. Adriana didn't know how she could afford the program.
 June didn't understand the sacrifices her mother had to make for her. She was just excited to  attend the summer program. She had never been in summer camp before. June was especially  excited because her friends would be there with her. Sometimes summer was boring especially  since her mom worked all day. June heard there would be games and crafts. She was going to  make something nice for her mom to thank her.

257. SPECIAL EDUCATION
 Emma felt really bad when someone from her daughter Jessica's school informed her that  Jessica needed special education services. Emma felt like she had failed as a mother. It was true  that Jessica was always delayed when it came to learning to talk and walk. Emma just thought  that her child was different. Every child develops at its own rate. Jessica was five years old now,  but still was not speaking in complete sentences. Jessica would not be attending a regular  kindergarten in a regular school. Instead, she would be attending kindergarten in a special  education school.
 While this bothered Emma at first, she soon learned to appreciate the school. Jessica had a  specialized learning plan called an Individualized Education Plan or IEP. This plan set up specific  goals for Jessica, like learning how to feed herself. Jessica also received a lot of individual  attention. Instead of her being in a classroom with 20 students, there were only 8 students in her  class. All of these students also were delayed like Jessica. In addition, the class had two teacher's  assistants to help the classroom teacher.
 The special education school also scheduled speech therapy sessions for Jessica. Once a  day a specialist would come in and work with Jessica to help her practice learning how to move  her mouth and tongue and ask for what she needed and wanted. An occupational therapist helped  Jessica learn to feed herself and other age appropriate self-sufficiency skills. A physical therapist  also came in to help Jessica.
 Emma may have been embarrassed at first that her daughter was in a special education  school, but after a year, Emma realized it was the best thing for her. While Jessica still was a little  behind other kids of her age, at the end of kindergarten, she was able to attend a non-special  education school.

258. STAY-AT-HOME DAD
 Chris knew many of the other fathers made fun of him. He was pretty sure some of the  mothers did too. He was the president of the Parent-Teacher Association at his daughter's school.
 He organized all the bake sales, book sales and met with the school principal regularly to share  concerns he heard from other parents. This is not why parents made fun of him. Other parents  made fun of him because this was all he did. Chris was a stay-at-home dad. His wife Maureen  had a demanding full-time job working for an investment bank. She made an excellent salary, but  the job meant going in early and coming home late.
 Chris was never good at holding a regular job. He got bored easily. He'd rather focus on his  daughter and what was going on at her school. He became the main caregiver. Chris handled all  of the household duties. He took his daughter to and from school. He did all the grocery shopping  and cooked all the meals. He cleaned the house and helped his daughter with her homework.
 Everyone in the neighborhood called Chris "Mr. Mom". There were other names Chris heard  people calling him, like "house husband" and "house-spouse".
 Chris didn't mind his role at all. He felt secure as a man. He didn't believe that a woman's  place was in the home. He was glad that his wife loved her job and worked hard. He worked hard,  too. He just didn't get a salary like Maureen did. He was happy being paid the love and  appreciation from his family.
 Sometimes Chris felt lonely though. When he took his daughter to the park, there were no  other dads around. He felt strange talking to the mothers. He didn't want them to think he was  hitting on them or trying to pick them up.

259. A TIME FOR FAMILY
 December is truly a special time. People start putting up their Christmas decorations and  lights outside their homes. Christmas is wonderful, because family members from far-away come  to visit. We eat, drink, and talk about how our lives are going. One of my favorite things to do  when my family comes over to visit is go for a ride in my dad's car and see all the houses with  their Christmas lights on.
 Last year, my dad told us that he had seen a neighborhood with the whole block filled with  houses with lights. We decided to go see them. The whole family crammed into two cars. We  drove for about 40 minutes. When we got there, our faces lit up with joy at the sight of all the  lights. My cousins decided that they wanted to walk outside and watch the lights. We all got out  and started walking, but when it was time to go back home, we didn't notice that my youngest  brother was not in the car.
 He had separated from the family, and went to see a house all the way at the end. No one  noticed, and we left him there for an hour. He knocked on the house that he went to see, and told  the people that lived there what had happened. He knew my cell phone number, and so he called  me. We were about to arrive at my house when I got the call. I told my dad, and he nearly crashed  the car, because he got so scared.
 We dropped everyone off and I decided to go with my dad to pick up my brother. When we  arrived at the house, my brother was sitting on the couch watching television with the children that  lived there and drinking hot chocolate. My dad hugged him and said sorry. The people who lived  there said that it was fine that their children liked my brother because he was funny. They said he  could come back anytime. I was relieved nothing had happened to my brother.

260. SHOPPING ON BLACK FRIDAY
 Janice was one of those people that loved getting up early for the Black Friday sales stores  have after Thanksgiving Day. She loved going to her favorite stores to see what she could get on  sale. A friend told her that her favorite store was going to have an amazing sale. They were going  to sell an 60-inch television for $300. Janice wanted to make sure she was there early. She went  to the store during the night and set up a tent to sleep over night.
 Janice noticed that no one else had showed up when she was getting her tent ready, but she  didn't care. She loved being there. She was so excited about the sales that she couldn't get any  sleep. At around 3:30 a.m. she finally fell asleep. She set the alarm on her phone to wake her up  at 6 a.m., but because she left her music playing when she fell asleep, her phone ran out of  battery.
 At around 8 a.m. a man who worked at the store came out and woke Janice up. She was  surprised and asked him what time it was. He said it was 8 a.m. and she couldn't believe it. She  went into the store and left her tent behind. She wanted to see if they still had the televisions.
 Janice saw that they didn't. People started looking at her, because her hair was a mess. She felt  embarrassed and went back to get her stuff.
 While she was going back home, she noticed another store that was open. She decided to go  in, and was surprised to see that they had the television she wanted. It was $500, instead of $300.
 She bought the television and asked one of the workers if they could take it out to her truck. She  went home and asked her brother to help her move the television. Once she got the television into  her home, she climbed into bed and fell asleep.

261. VINYL HUNTING
 Adrian loves to collect vinyl records. He got his first record from his grandpa. It was a record of  Louis Armstrong. His grandpa even gave him a record player to play his records. The only thing  Adrian didn't like was that he lived in a small town, so there weren't any stores that sold records.
 His brother told him to try looking on Craigslist.
 Adrian looked on Craigslist for people who were selling records of his favorite bands. He had  to look for sellers in the nearest city, and found one. His brother went into the city every week.
 Adrian asked his brother if he could go with him next time. His brother said yes. The person he  found was selling his whole record collection for $200. Adrian was excited and took out the money  he had been saving. Adrian's brother told him he had read about bad stuff happening to people  over Craigslist.
 They emailed the guy that was selling the records and told him to meet at a Starbucks. When  Adrian and his brother got there, they saw the guy outside of the Starbucks drinking a coffee. He  had a box of records with him. The guy told him that it actually wasn't his collection; it belonged to  his brother who had passed away. He wanted to sell it to someone who would appreciate them  and listen to them every day, like his brother once had. Adrian said that he would play one record  a day.
 When Adrian got into his brother's car, he started looking through the records. He saw a copy  of "Abbey Road," by The Beatles and was happy. When he took the record out, he couldn't  believe what he saw. It was autographed by all four members of the band.

262. NO-HITTER
 Rocky was a big baseball fan. He lived in Philadelphia, but was originally from Los Angeles.
 He made sure to go watch the Dodgers every time they played the Phillies. Rocky will never forget  the last game he saw at Citizen's Bank Ballpark, which is where the Phillies play.
 It started off as a normal game for Rocky. He sat out in the stands with his girlfriend. He was  fully dressed as a Dodgers fan. He had a Dodgers hat, jersey, and shirt. As the game came to the  seventh inning, which is the seventh inning stretch and everyone starts singing "Take me out to  the Ballpark," he noticed that the Dodgers pitcher Josh Beckett had been pitching a no-hitter. A  no-hitter is when a pitcher doesn't allow a player on the other team to get a hit. Rocky got excited,  because he never would have thought he would see a no-hitter, especially the Dodgers pitch a no hitter.
 Rocky was holding on to his beer, but he wasn't drinking it. He was watching the baseball  game very closely. His girlfriend would talk, but he wouldn't listen. As Beckett threw the final pitch,  Rocky held his breath. He saw that it was a strike and jumped out of his chair. He even spilled  some of his beer on his girlfriend, but she didn't care. She was happy as well. Rocky was thrilled.
 He started yelling loudly. He celebrated with other Dodger fans that were there and drank the rest  of his beer.
 When he got home, Rocky turned on the television. He put the highlights of the game on  ESPN and saw that he had come out on television. His girlfriend saw it and was excited. It was  the best ending to the best baseball game he had ever been to.

263. HELPING THE NEEDY
 Age doesn't matter when it comes to helping out the needy. Shane is a 9-year-old boy that  loves to help out. During a school field trip, Shane's class went to visit a warehouse where people  donate food and clothes for the homeless. Shane was inspired by the workers he saw there.
 When he got home, he told his mom all about his field trip. Shane told his mom that he wanted to  go help out.
 A week later, Shane's mom told him the good news. They were going to help out at a local  kitchen that gave food to the homeless. Shane got excited. He got his coat and shoes. As Shane  and his mom were getting to the local kitchen, Shane saw how all the homeless people were  living. He saw the tents in the street and how some people didn't even have shoes. He got sad,  and told his mom that he was going to make sure everyone had shoes, food, and blankets.
 When they got inside, the manager of the kitchen thanked Shane and his mom for coming  down to help. They started serving food to the homeless and everyone that passed by thanked  Shane for coming down to help. Shane felt safe and started talking to the homeless people. He  told them that he wanted to help them. When they finished, Shane didn't want to leave, but they  had to.

264. A VISIT TO STATUE OF LIBERTY
 It has always been a dream of mine to visit New York. My parents always talked about going  to New York, but we never went. I loved a lot of things about New York, but one thing that I really  wanted to see was the Statue of Liberty. My parents aren't from the United States, but I was born  here. They saw the Statue of Liberty as something more, not just as something people wanted to  go see and take pictures of.
 My parents never saw the Statue of Liberty because we lived in Texas. They crossed the  border, and longed to see the Statue of Liberty with their own eyes, but never got the chance. I  decided that I was going to fulfill their dream. I finally saved enough money for a plane ticket, and  went to stay with a friend that I had met at home but now in New York. We talked over the  Internet, and she told me that if I ever got the chance to go to New York, I could stay with her. I  called her the day I got my plane ticket.
 "Guess who's going to New York," I said. She started yelling and saying that it was going to be  a lot of fun. I told her that my first stop had to be the Statue of Liberty. She told me that she  couldn't wait. When I got out of the plane, I couldn't believe how cold it was. I got my luggage and  met my friend outside of the airport. I hugged her and we got a taxi to take us to her home.
 When we got to her house, she showed me her room and told me we would be leaving for the  Statue of Liberty in an hour. I took a shower and put on two sweaters. We got a taxi, and went to  see the Statue of Liberty. It took a while, but we finally got to the island. I couldn't believe the  Statue of Liberty was right before my eyes. I started crying, and felt my parents were right here  with me. I always felt like a foreigner in this country even though I was born here. Now I  understood why they wanted to visit the Statue of Liberty so much.

265. A HOMELESS MAN
 There is a saying "One man's trash is another man's treasure," meaning I might not like  something and throw it away, and then someone might love it and take it. I remember seeing a  homeless guy searching trash cans looking for something he could sell. I asked him why he did  that. He looked at me and said "One man's trash is another man's treasure," which I didn't  understand at that time.
 In fact, he was collecting stuff he needed not only to sell, but stuff he needed to make his  home. This man lived in the park by my house. No one really bothered him because he was  respectful and would clean up after himself. I went running in the park one day and saw him  putting together a bed with stuff he had collected from the trash. He always looked for clean stuff.
 If it had food trash on it, he wouldn't take it. I went back to my car and took a blanket to him. He  saw it and thanked me.
 I remember one day the police were bothering him because they had to take away his stuff.
 The members of the neighborhood went to the police and told them that he wasn't hurting  anybody by being there. The homeless man looked at everyone and thanked them, but told the  police to take his home away if they had to. "I know you guys are just doing your job. Go ahead,"  he said.
 When the police heard him say that, they decided to leave him alone. He has been there for a  couple of years now. He has even started planting a garden outside by the football field. People  often go and give him food and other items he might need. He has made trash into his treasure.

266. BEING CHARGED WITH ARSON
 Carl was just 15 when he was charged with arson. He snuck into his high school with a friend  and lit the auditorium curtains on fire. They thought they would have gotten away with it, but the  store across the street from the school had a camera that saw Carl and his friend come out of the  school. The police caught Carl and his friend while they were eating at a restaurant that was next  to the high school. They were taken to jail.
 Carl admitted to burning down the auditorium, and got sentenced for 10 years in prison. His  friend got the same. The judge asked them why they did it, and Carl said, "Because we were  bored and we didn't like the school."  News reporters were at the school. They wanted to talk to the parents, who were at the school  talking to the police and the principal. Carl's father came out first and was on his way to the police  station when a news reporter asked him about the situation. He said, "My son just lost his  childhood, and he will never get that back. Carl was never a bad child, but he started acting up  when he got to high school. His mom couldn't believe what he had done. People make mistakes,  and Carl's mistake is going to cost him a lot."  The principal said that the school will be working hard to get the auditorium rebuilt, but it will  take a couple of years. The school says that it will cost a million dollars to rebuild the auditorium.
 According to his parents, Carl said that he wishes he could take it all back and that it was a stupid  mistake.

267. A BABY GIRL
 My mom was pregnant with her second child. I was happy because I was going to be a big  brother. My dad and mom told me that it was going to be a boy. I was excited, because that meant  I could boss him around and tell him to do my chores. She told all her friends that she was having  a boy. Her friends all gave her their extra boy clothes that their sons had used, and my mom loved  it.
 My dad was busy working on the crib for the baby. He painted it blue, and put a blanket with  race cars inside. When my mom went into the hospital, my dad was excited and jumping up and  down, but after my mom had the baby, my dad came out with a confused look on his face. I asked  him what was wrong, if the baby was okay. He looked at me and said yes, but that the baby was  actually a girl. My grandma looked at him, and smacked him in the head. She said, "That's  wonderful news. Don't look so depressed!"  My dad laughed and said "No, I'm not depressed, I'm just confused." For the first three months  of her life, my sister looked like a boy. She wore nothing but boy's clothes, because that's all my  parents had gotten for her. I took a lot of pictures, so I could tell her later that she was actually a  boy, but an accident happened that changed her into a girl. My mom deleted all my photos  because it was mean.
 I'll never forget the look on my dad's face when he came out of the delivery room. He looked  like he was trying to solve a big math problem in his head. It was like he was trying to count from  one to a million, luckily my grandma slapped it out of him.

268. AN EASTER BUNNY
 Gabriel loved working as a waiter. He loved going to work during holidays like Christmas,  Thanksgiving, and Easter. When there was work during holidays, it usually meant there would be  a big tip in his check. He was very friendly with the people, and everyone liked working with him.
 The restaurant where he worked was doing a special brunch for Easter this year. Gabriel's boss  Jackie called him to see if he could work. Gabriel said yes.
 When Gabriel showed up, he saw a giant Easter bunny walking around the restaurant. He  started chuckling to himself. He had always wanted to wear a costume, and walk around talking to  people. As people started showing up, he noticed that the Easter bunny wasn't coming out to  greet the people. Gabriel had a job to do though. He started cleaning the tables he was assigned;  when he finished, he went to take his break.
 While he was eating, Jackie went up to Gabriel and said "I think we need you to take over as  the Easter bunny, would you be willing to do that?" Gabriel said of course, because he didn't want  to let down the boss, but also because he secretly wanted to do it. As he walked out fully dressed  like the Easter Bunny, he saw children lining up to take pictures with him. He walked over and  took pictures with everyone that was in line.
 There was a little train for the children outside in the garden. After he took the pictures, he  decided to go on the train and ride it with the children. The children were asking him if he was the  real Easter Bunny, and if he had been to Disneyland, Gabriel nodded his head. After he got off the  train, he walked around the restaurant and started dancing in the restaurant. People started to  applaud as they ate. It was the first time Gabriel ever dressed up as the Easter Bunny, but he  loved every second of it.

269. THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GIRL IN THE WORLD
 Karen and Jack had been trying to have a child for many years with no success. All that  changed one day, when they received the greatest gift in the world. That day, nearly one year ago,  they had a healthy baby girl. They named her Julie, and it was the happiest day of their lives.
 Karen loves to dress Julie up in pretty pastel colors complete with bows and ribbons. Karen  thinks she's the most beautiful girl in the world. The other day, the small family went shopping, and  all of a sudden, Karen let out a loud scream! "Oh, my god!" Jack ran over thinking something had  gone wrong. "What's the matter?" he asked. "Nothing," she answered. "Look at this adorable  outfit. It's perfect for little Julie," she said. Jack got a little upset about this. He was running toward  Karen thinking she had fallen or that something had happened to Julie, but all that happened is  that she found a pretty blue dress for their baby girl.
 Shopping malls in the United States are all over the country. Some are very large, but most of  them have anywhere between 50 to 100 shops each. They are places people go to eat and shop,  or go to see a movie, or just hang out with friends. American teenagers love these places,  especially in Los Angeles, when it gets very warm. The kids go there to cool off. It was no surprise  Karen wanted to go there to buy little Julie her dress. If shoppers don't find what they are looking  for in one shop, there's always another one close by at a shopping mall.
 Karen kept talking about how perfect the outfit she found was and that she "absolutely had to  find the right shoes to go with it. Of course she did find those shoes, and that made her very  happy, and Jack too. Julie is going to look so pretty in her new outfit.

270. JOSH'S FIRST GIRLFRIEND
 This is how Josh met his first girlfriend. He was 12 years old and in the seventh grade. He had  known Diana since she was a little girl, but he was shy and never talked to her. She was very  pretty, and Josh was afraid to say anything to her because he thought she wouldn't like him. Josh  had no self-confidence when he was a kid. He finally got the courage to talk to her one April day.
 The school was right on a busy street, so a crossing guard helped students cross to the other  side. The guard carried a sign over his head that said "Stop" so that cars would not hit anyone.
 The rule was that no one could cross the street without the guard, so everyone always waited.
 One day Josh got to the corner and the crossing guard was gone, so he decided to cross the  street alone. That's when he heard "Hey! You're not supposed to cross the street alone!" It was  the crossing guard. Josh didn't see him because the guard was behind a bush tying his shoes.
 Josh was so scared. From that day on, he decided to go all the way around the block to avoid  seeing the guard. He knew the guard would report him to the school.
 What happened next was something he could not believe. It turned out Diana went around the  block too, but Josh didn't know that then. He accidentally ran into her one day and they started to  talk. One thing led to another, and soon Josh was looking forward to going home the long way.
 They started walking together and Josh discovered Diana was just as shy as he was! They  walked and talked every day and began liking each other. Soon they began telling everyone that  they were boyfriend and girlfriend. This just shows how something good could come from  something bad!

271. HIDE AND SEEK
 One of the best games children play in America is Hide and Seek. You didn't need anything to  play, and you could play for hours without getting bored. Another great thing about Hide and Seek  is that anyone could play, boys, girls, young, and old. Hide and Seek was great. All you needed  was a little imagination and a sense of adventure.
 The way the game is played is simple. I remember the first time I played. I came up to some of  my brother's friends who were playing in the neighborhood. "Hey, what are you guys playing?" I  asked. "We are playing Hide and Seek," said Robert, my brother's best friend. "Can I play?" I  asked, even though I didn't really know the rules. After a while, the boys let me play. The object of  the game is to hide from one of the players. This person closes his eyes and counts to 10 out loud  to start the game. While he or she is counting, the rest of the kids run to find a hiding place.
 Hiding places can be anywhere. Behind cars, or in the bushes, just about anywhere! It was  Robert's turn. When he had counted 10, he yelled, "Ready or not, here I come!" Whoever is the  first person found becomes "It", and it's their turn to count. I thought I had the best hiding place  ever. I was in the bushes near my house. I could see through the leaves everything Robert was  doing, and I knew he was getting close to finding David, another one of my friends.
 I was overjoyed that I wasn't going to be the first one found. I had proven myself to everybody  who said I was too young to play when all of a sudden, a mouse ran over my foot! I jumped and  screamed out of the bushes, and was the first one found. The next thing I knew, I was counting  out loud and trying to find my friends.

272. A NIGHT AT THE DRIVE-IN
 Many years ago, one of the best ways to spend a Saturday night with your girlfriend was to  take her to the drive-in. Drive-in theaters were first opened in Southern California because of the  car culture that exists here. People could go see a movie in the comfort and privacy of their own  car. I remember the first time I went to a drive-in. I was 18 years old and was dating my future wife  Caroline. We went on a double-date with my best friend Alfred and his girl Jeannie. The drive-in  we visited that night was called the Starlight. It was close to home, and it had the best sound  system of all the drive-ins. It also had a huge screen. We went to see "Forrest Gump" that night,  mainly because Carol wanted to see it. "I heard it is a great movie," she said. I really didn't know  anything about the movie, but I did want to see something.
 "Forrest Gump" was indeed one of the best movies ever made. It had everything -- humor,  drama, tragedy, and triumph. It is a great film. Watching it that night under the stars with Carol on  my arm was the greatest night. "I tell you babe, I was wrong about this movie. I really liked it," I  said. She just smiled and gave me a hug. Alfred and Jeannie were busy kissing in the back seat,  which is another advantage of going to a drive-in.
 Those old drive-ins were around for decades, but soon after "Forrest Gump" came out, many  of them started closing. They closed because of the new multiplex theaters popping up all over  the country. People had a choice of many films to watch at those theaters, and soon the drive-in  was gone. In Los Angeles, there is only one remaining drive-in I know of -- the Vineland. There  might be more, but I don't know where. It is sad to see them go, but the memories are still with  me.

273. HELLO DOLLY!
 "Hello Dolly" is one of the classic American plays. It was first shown in New York City in 1964  and won 10 Tony Awards. The Tony Awards are live theater's version of the Oscars. When I was in  high school, our theater department decided to put on our version of "Hello Dolly", and I just had  to get involved. I wasn't an actor, but I was hoping there was something I could do, so I went to  the director and asked him if he needed help. To my surprise, he said yes!
 The director's name was Michael Thomas. I almost screamed in delight when he said I could  be a part of the play. "Oh, my god!" I said. "I would love to be a stagehand. Are you kidding me?"  A stagehand is someone who moves all the props and background in between acts. It is precision  work that takes coordination between several people. I loved working in the "wings", which is what  the backstage in called in theater lingo. The stage manager is the person who runs the backstage  during a play, and the job carries a lot of responsibility. My first stage manager was a cool guy who  liked me a lot, so I got the best assignments. "Hey George, how would you like to man the  lighting?" he asked, and I jumped at the opportunity.
 "You bet, boss!" I responded. That was how I got put in charge of the lighting for one of the  best plays ever written. Even though this was just a high school production, we played to packed  houses almost every night we were on. I did such a great job that when the theater department  decided to put on "West Side Story" the next semester, they asked me if I wanted to join the team.
 It was such an honor to be selected, so of course my answer was yes!

274. DODGERS VS. GIANTS
 One of the greatest American traditions is the game of baseball. Living in Los Angeles has  given me the chance to watch one of the oldest baseball teams in the history of the game -- the  Dodgers. The team came into existence in New York City in the 1880s, when they were known by  several names. Until 1956, the Dodgers played in Brooklyn New York, but in 1957, the team  moved west to Los Angeles, and it has played there ever since.
 I recently asked my wife Josie if she wanted to go to a game one night, and of course she  said yes. "Why wouldn't I want to go? The weather is great and the stadium is beautiful. Besides, I  think we need a break in our routine," she said. "You're absolutely right, baby. Let's go!" I said.
 We were off to Dodger Stadium, which is nestled in the hills just north of downtown L.A. in a  neighborhood called Chavez Ravine. Even though it is the third oldest stadium in the country, it is  still beautiful. "Wow. This place never gets old," I said as we got to our seats. Josie agreed. It was  a perfect night for a ball game. The temperature was in the low 70s, and it was a clear, breezy  night.
 The Dodgers were playing the Giants that night. The two teams have been playing each other  for about 100 years, ever since both teams were in New York. The Giants moved the same year  the Dodgers did. only they moved up north to San Francisco. That didn't stop the rivalry though.
 The teams hate each other today as much as they did back in New York. The best part of the  night was that the Dodgers won, so I had a couple of Dodger Dogs. "I don't know what they do to  these hot dogs, but they are delicious," I told Josie. She wiped some mustard off her face and  said, "Absolutely!"

275. HALLOWEEN COSTUME PARTY
 "Did you get your costume done last night?" I asked my girlfriend Audrey in the early morning  of October 31. "Of course, it was ready, but you're not going to see it until tonight," she said. That  was a real disappointment. I had been looking forward to seeing her latest Halloween creation.
 Audrey is a fine seamstress, and every year she makes the best costumes for the Halloween  parties we try to attend. On the other hand, I usually just put some old rags on and go as a hobo  or a pirate, or something lame like that, but not Audrey. She goes all out. Last year, she went as a  beautiful witch complete with the pointy hat and witch's broom. She looked beautiful.
 The Halloween tradition is very old in the United States. No one really knows how it was first  celebrated, but it did come from somewhere in Europe. It was originally called "All Hallows Eve",  and celebrated on last day of October. It precedes "All Hallows Day", which is a day to honor dead  relatives. Today, it means parties for the adults and "Trick or treating" for the kids. "Trick or  treating" is where kids also dress up in costumes and go door to door to get candy treats. It's a  whole lot of fun.
 Some people say Halloween is a Welsh, or Celtic tradition, while others say its roots are  Christian, but it doesn't really matter anymore. We just like to get dressed up like fools, go to  parties, and eat lots of candy! Audrey finally showed up at my door. She was strikingly beautiful.
 She was dressed as a fairy princess and was glowing in her white gown. "You look amazing," I  told her. She just laughed and said, "I know," and tapped me with her wand.

276. THE COKE BOTTLES
 When I was 13 years old, I loved playing the drums. I guess banging on the drums gave me  an emotional outlet for a very troubled time in my youth. When you're 13, everything seems to  come at you from all directions. The drums helped me cope with being a teenager. One day, I  called my friend Rudy on the phone. Rudy loved playing around with his guitar. Neither one of us  had ever taken music lessons, but we loved our instruments. "Hey Rudy, why don't you come  over? We can play for a while," I suggested. "No problem, man. If it's okay with you, I'll bring my  cousin Bobby with me. He plays the bass guitar." I told him that would be great and waited for  them to arrive.
 Bobby didn't just play the bass, he jammed at it. "You're really rock on that bass, Bobby," I told  him. He said he had been playing for years and wanted to form a band. We all looked at each  other, and it hit us like a bolt of lightning. "We can do this!" Rudy and I said at the same time. "All  we need is a vocalist," I said, to which Bobby chirped, "I can do that, too!" That was the beginning  of the best Rock 'N' Roll band ever. "The Coke Bottles". Of course that was an exaggeration, but it  turned out we were pretty good for a bunch of novices.
 The three of us began meeting at my place every week to practice playing together and to  bounce song ideas off each other. Bobby could actually sing. With Rudy and me putting in all  those hours of practice, we got pretty good. We got so good that we played at a couple of parties  and at a free Concert in the Park festival about a year later. That was as far as we got though.
 Rudy joined the Army the following year. Bobby and I were never able to find another lead  guitarist, so the greatest Rock 'N' Roll band "The Coke Bottles" never made it big, but that was  okay with me. We had our day in the sun.

277. GOING TO COLLEGE
 Two years ago, I graduated from high school. My father, mother, and sisters all came to see  me walk up the stage to receive my diploma. Most of my extended family was there too, including  my aunts and uncles, and some of my best friends.
 To my surprise, my friend Eddie, who graduated from the same school the year before, came  up to congratulate me as soon as the ceremony was over. "Hey! Feels great, doesn't it?" said  Eddie. "It sure does," I responded excitedly. Eddie was like a big brother to me. He joined the  Navy after graduation. now that I was out of high school, he came back specifically to talk to me  about my plans. I had no idea he was coming because he wanted it to be a surprise, and it sure  was.
 "Okay, now that you're out of high school, what are you going to do with your life?" he asked.
 To tell the truth, I didn't have a clue. Most of my classmates knew exactly where they wanted to go  to college, or if they were going to join the military. Some of them were like me, clueless. No one  had ever been interested enough in me to try to give me some guidance except Eddie. He told me  about college and I should consider going to a community college since I hadn't applied to a four year university. I was very interested, but confused. "You never went to college, Eddie. How do  you know it's the right thing to do?" I asked. Eddie just smiled and said he just knew and that I  needed to trust him on this one.
 Since I trusted him like a brother, I took his advice and enrolled in a community college. It's  been quite an experience. I must admit, Eddie was right. I will be transferring to UCLA next  semester and things are looking up for me. I owe it all to my "big brother" Eddie.

278. DRIVING UP PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY
 Living in Southern California has its advantages. One of those advantages is living so near  the mighty Pacific Ocean. It is the largest ocean in the world -- big, blue, and beautiful. One of my  favorite pastimes when I was growing up was taking a long drive up Pacific Coast Highway. It is a  beautiful drive, winding lazily in and out of sight of the sea, and going up hills and down coastal  valleys. For first-time cruisers, it could be breathtaking.
 One lazy Saturday, I was a bit bored, so I called my girlfriend, who was studying for her  English test on the coming Monday, to see if she wanted to go for a ride. "Hey Sheila, want to go  for a cruise?" She hemmed and hawed for a while before finally agreeing to go with me. "Where  are we going?" she asked, but I wanted it to be a surprise. She had been hitting the books pretty  hard lately because of her upcoming mid-term exams. I figured she needed a break, and so did I.
 We started driving. Soon we were going through the Santa Monica tunnel. This tunnel is  especially nice. When you enter it, you have no clue what is waiting at the other end. As soon as  the exit comes into view, the ocean, in all its glory, appears right before your eyes. Sheila was  instantly delighted. She turned to me after a while and said "Thanks, baby. I really needed this." I  said "Me too, babe."  We talked for what seemed like hours. After that we went up and down, left and right, with the  ocean as our companion. We ended up in Santa Barbara, a coastal town about 140 miles north of  Los Angeles. It was getting late, so we decided to stay for the night. Santa Barbara is a college  town, so it's easy to find affordable rooms to spend the night. That was one of the best nights of  my young life.

279. MARY, TOM, AND BUDDY (1)
 Mary was a girl with long brown hair and pretty eyes. Every evening she would take her dog  out for a walk. Mary's dog was a Beagle. She had named him Buddy because he was so friendly  to everybody he met. Buddy never barked or bit anyone when Mary took him out on his walks.
 Buddy did not even flinch at the sight of cats and other dogs. He truly was a buddy to all.
 One night, as Mary was walking Buddy, something unexpected occurred. For the first time in  his life, Buddy became aggravated. "What's the matter, Buddy?" Mary asked. Buddy replied only  in barks, as if he was trying to communicate back. All of a sudden, the wind grew still and the air  became cold. Mary decided to turn around and head back home. But before she could, a raspy  voice called out her name. Mary right away turned around and yelled, "Who's there?" Buddy had  stopped barking.
 A boy stepped forward from the shadows and slowly revealed his identity. "Tom, is that you?"  Mary asked the timid boy, who was now in plain sight. Tom was looking down at the floor with his  hand in his pockets. "What are you doing, Tom? Have you been following me?" Mary asked,  slightly confused. Tom stood there embarrassed and slowly started talking. "I'm sorry I snuck up  on you. I didn't mean to frighten you," Tom first said. Mary could tell that Tom was nervous. She  also knew of the feelings Tom had for her.
 "It's not safe for someone like you to be walking at night all alone," Tom said. "I'm not alone. I  have Buddy," Mary replied. "You should have somebody accompanying you and Buddy on nights  like these," said Tom. "Would you like to tag along, Tom?" Mary asked. Tom was too struck to  answer. He had been waiting for this moment to happen.

280. MARY, TOM, AND BUDDY (2)
 Mary and Tom became fast friends after their nightly meet-up. Every night at seven o'clock,  Tom would pick up Mary at her house and the two would walk Buddy around the neighborhood for  about an hour. Mary no longer walked Buddy alone at night, and Tom no longer followed Mary.
 One night, as they were walking Buddy, Mary and Tom decided to grab a bite to eat because  they were hungry. "Where do you want to eat?" Tom asked Marry. "Let's go to Pizza Mountain,"  she replied. "I don't feel like eating pizza right now," Tom said. "Do you have any suggestions?"  Mary asked. "How about going back to my house? I'll cook our own food!" Tom said. Mary thought  this was a great idea. The two headed back to the street where they lived and thought about what  to cook on the way.
 When they arrived, they had decided on making hamburgers. Mary wrote down a list of  ingredients they were going to need to make the hamburgers. Tom went to the refrigerator and  took out all the ingredients that he had. "Where are the buns?" Mary asked when she saw they  were missing. "I'll run to the market and get some hamburger buns," Tom said. By the time Tom  came back from the market, Mary had prepared the food. All they needed to do now was to put  the food between the buns.
 Mary and Tom were about to take their first bites into their burgers when Buddy came in  through the door wagging his tail and salivating. "I think he wants a burger," Tom said. Mary rose  from her seat and made a burger for Buddy. Buddy ate the burger in one bite as soon as Mary  handed it to him.

281. ALWAYS SAFETY FIRST
 In a small town of California, there lived a boy by the name of Desmond Walker. Desmond  lived with his mom and dad in a red three-bedroom house. Desmond was ten years old and had  an active imagination. His mother had her hands full watching over Desmond. That boy of hers  would get in all sorts of trouble. "Always safety first, Desmond!" is what she always repeated to  her son.
 Desmond and his mother went out grocery shopping one Friday evening. The supermarket's  parking lot was jam-packed with cars that Friday evening. "Stick close to me, Desmond," said his  mom as they entered the supermarket. Desmond's mom asked him to fetch a shopping cart. He  grabbed a shopping cart, and started heading back to where his mom was. Desmond then  hopped on the shopping cart and raced away at top speed. "That's not too smart, Desmond," said  a voice in Desmond's head. Desmond stopped and began pushing the cart like before. He  remembered what his mom always said to him, "Always safety first".
 After Desmond handed the cart to his mother, the two headed towards the dairy section to  grab some milk. "Desmond, stay close to me," Desmond's mom said. The supermarket was  bustling with shoppers. Desmond stood close to his mother as they treaded carefully through the  hordes of people. Then, in an instance, Desmond thought of running away and hiding from his  mom as a trick. Just as he was about to do so, Desmond heard the voice again. "That's not a  good idea, Desmond," the voice said. Desmond had remembered his mom's golden rule: "Always  safety first."  "You've been such a good boy today," Desmond's mom said to Desmond. Desmond said  thank you and was treated to ice-cream as a reward.

282. EDDIE AND JAKE FORM A ROCK BAND
 Eddie loved to play the guitar. His favorite kind of music to play and listen to was Rock and  Roll. Eddie had been playing the guitar since the age of thirteen. He had an older brother who  also played the guitar. It was his older brother who first taught him how to play the guitar. Eddie,  now seventeen years old, aspired to be a famous musician one day. He knew he could not do this  by himself, so he set out on a talent search for someone to play alongside with him.
 One day Eddie met another guitar player named Jake. Jake was around the same age as  Eddie. Both Eddie and Jake shared a similar taste in music. When Eddie asked Jake if he would  like to form a band, Jake said yes. "What's the name of our band?" Jake asked. Eddie had not  thought of a name for the group yet. "I'm open to any suggestions you might have," Eddie said to  Jake. The next day, Jake thought of a perfect name. Eddie liked the name as soon as he heard it.
 From then on, the name of Eddie and Jake's band was Jetsam.
 Eddie and Jake started learning how to play songs on their guitars together. Although they  both listened to a variety of Rock groups, they focused primarily on learning the songs of their  favorite ensemble -- The Beatles. Almost everybody loved The Beatles. Learning to sing and play  their songs seemed like the best thing to do.
 After learning a handful of songs, Eddie and Jake both felt ready to perform in front of an  audience. Eddie and Jake got their acoustic guitars and performed at an open music night at the  local community center. The audience roared with thunderous applause after Jetsam's set ended.
 Eddie and Jake bowed and thanked the audience for coming.

283. LEARNING SPANISH
 Learning another language is a difficult task, but not impossible. Andrew knew the challenge  that lied ahead, but was determined to achieve his goal of learning Spanish. Andrew wanted to  learn Spanish because his girlfriend's family was from Guatemala. Andrew had already learned  some basic words. Yes in Spanish was si, no was no, and thank you was gracias. It was just a  matter of time before he became fluent and began talking to his girlfriend's relatives.
 Andrew had been receiving lessons from his next door neighbor Jose. Jose was fluent in both  Spanish and English. He was born in Mexico, and immigrated to the United States at the age of  ten. Jose was happy to teach Andrew Spanish. Andrew insisted on paying Jose for the lessons,  even though Jose had offered to do it for free. After a few months, Andrew was able to  communicate well enough to hold a simple conversation. Andrew decided to test his Spanish by  introducing himself in Spanish to his girlfriend.
 "Hola, mi nombre es Andrew," Andrew said with a smile on his face. He had said in perfect  Spanish, "Hello, my name is Andrew". His girlfriend was impressed at his Spanish as they shared  a conversation about the weather. Jose's lessons had paid off.
 Andrew realized that if he wished to keep progressing in learning Spanish, the best thing to do  was to enroll in a Spanish course at the community college. That's exactly what he did the  following day. Andrew asked some of his friends if they would like to learn Spanish with him at the  community college. "No, thank you," most of them said. Andrew's friends thought it would be too  hard to learn Spanish. Little did his friends know, Spanish wasn't that hard to learn. Andrew had  learned this firsthand.

284. GOING BACK TO SCHOOL
 It's never too late to learn. Emily Johnson had turned thirty when she decided to go back to  college to finish her degree. Ten years had passed since she last attended East Los Angeles  College. It had been her dream to finish her two years at ELAC and transfer to Cal State L.A.
 Emily was not able to finish because she started working. Even though Emily found a good job,  she still had the urge to complete her education. After all, what kind of example would she be  setting for her daughters by not receiving her degree? Emily wanted her children to succeed by  going to college and getting a better career than she had.
 Emily was aware of the difficulties of going to school while working and taking care of two  daughters. She braced herself and accepted the challenge. She went to work during the daytime,  and went to class in the evening after taking her daughters to her mother's house. Emily had to  maintain this routine for one year in order to transfer. Sure enough, she made it through, and was  accepted into Cal State L.A.
 Emily's time at the university was slightly more grueling compared to community college. She  had been studying sociology. The same challenges presented themselves again. Emily had only  completed her general education classes at community college, and now the focus was in her  subject of interest.
 Emily passed all her classes with flying colors in a span of two years. It took all her dedication  and will power to finish her education. Emily received her bachelor's degree in sociology. Her  daughters would look up to their mother in the years to come and realize that it's never too late to  go back to school.

285. JOHNNY'S LONG HAIR (1)
 "When are you going to get a haircut?" Johnny's relatives would ask whenever they saw him.
 Johnny's reply was always the same, "When pigs start to fly." Although Johnny was aware that his  relatives thought he was funny, he was also aware of their concern regarding his long shoulder length hair. Johnny's hair was black and wavy. He began growing it after high school. Two years  had passed since then, and Johnny had no intention of cutting it anytime soon.
 Johnny loved his long hair, and took good care of it. Every day he would wash it and brush it  fifty times. Johnny felt so cool with his long hair. It made him look like a rock star. While in high  school, Johnny always had short hair. Although it did not look unappealing, he was not too fond of  his short hair, and desired to grow it out one day. He made a promise to himself to do so after  graduation. Johnny had gone through with his promise.
 Johnny's hair received plenty of attention. As he walked down the street, he often heard "Nice  hair, kid!" from strangers. "Thank you very much," Johnny would reply, feeling flattered. Once,  Johnny passed by a group of girls who giggled and looked at him. "I like your hair," one of them  said to Johnny as he walked away. Being the cool cat that he now was, Johnny loved every  minute of having long hair.
 Johnny wondered why he didn't decide to let his hair grow sooner. It was the best decision he  had ever made, and nothing in the world could make him cut it.

286. JOHNNY'S LONG HAIR (2)
 Johnny enjoyed walking around with his long black hair. He also enjoyed the attention  strangers and friends would give him. Strolling down the street was never the same after he  started doing it with long hair. Johnny never wanted to cut his hair short ever again. He could think  of no good reason to do so. This would all change with one conversation on a Saturday morning  while having breakfast with his parents.
 It seemed like any other regular Saturday morning at Johnny's house. Mom was cooking  pancakes; dad was reading the newspaper; Johnny was waiting, sitting at the table drinking some  orange juice. "Johnny, it is time for you to get a job," Johnny's dad said all of a sudden, without  any warning. Johnny nearly spit out his orange juice after hearing his dad's startling remark.
 "What?" Johnny said after gulping.
 "There comes a time in every boy's life when he must finally cut his hair and get a job,"  Johnny's dad told him. "But, dad!" Johnny said, trying reasoning. "No buts," Johnny's dad  snapped. That afternoon Johnny's parents took him to a barber shop to get a haircut. He tried his  best to hold back his tears on the way to the barber shop.
 Johnny reluctantly sat down on the barber's chair wearing a frown on his face. "Why the long  face?" asked the barber. "He doesn't want to get a haircut," Johnny's mom replied. "It's just hair.
 It'll grow back one day," the barber said, trying to cheer him up.
 The following week, Johnny was hired at McDonald's. He had neat short hair.

287. THE FRIENDSHIP
 Tony was really excited to see his friend Kevin. They had been friends since elementary  school all the way through high school. When they started college, they both headed their  separate ways. Tony wanted to study in electrical engineering, and Kevin wanted to become a  doctor. Their career choices led them into different directions, but their friendship was still intact.
 Tony and Kevin had been very close friends in elementary school. They started their  friendship while doing a small painting assignment. When Kevin noticed Tony painting a really  nice rocket, Kevin complimented him on it and the two started talking about their interest in other  things. What really kept them together at that moment was when Tony acknowledged Kevin's  reaction when Tony accidentally dropped his set of paints on the classroom floor. Tony was  embarrassed and terrified, but Kevin wasn't hesitant to help him out by cleaning it up.
 Growing up, Tony and Kevin shared similar interests. When they were in elementary school,  they both shared a dream of becoming astronauts and flying in spaceships to discover unknown  galaxies and unknown life forms. In middle school, they both shared the dream of becoming  famous basketball players. Then, in high school, they both had the urge to become famous rock  stars.
 It wasn't always a cheerful friendship. Sometimes, they both fought and shared different views  about different things. Despite their differences, Tony and Kevin didn't tear their friendship apart.
 In moments of grief and doubts, they were there to support each other.
 Tony and Kevin have both recently received their bachelor's degree. They have kept in  contact up until now, and have decided to get together and catch up on lost time.

288. A NEW FRIEND
 Sandra was an eight-year-old girl. Her best friend used to be her neighbor, who had  unfortunately moved to another state about a month ago. Sandra was upset about her friend's  move. They still send emails and text messages to each other to keep in contact, but she already  felt their friendship falling apart.
 Recently, a new family had moved into the house where her friend used to live in. It was a  family of four, a married couple with two children. One of the children was a five-year-old boy, and  the other was a girl who was one year older than Sandra. Sandra's mother and father had gone  over to introduce themselves as neighbors. Sandra's mother suggested Sandra head over and do  the same. Sandra was not fond of the idea. Nonetheless, Sandra's mother insisted and forced her  to introduce herself to their new neighbors.
 When walking over, Sandra noticed the five-year-old boy of the neighbor's family playing in  the mud in their front yard. Sandra approached him and said, "Hi, I'm Sandra. We are neighbors.
 What is your name?" The boy looked up at Sandra and yelled, "I'm Benjamin!" He then flung a  mud ball at Sandra. She screamed in shock. Benjamin's older sister then ran out of her house to  see what was going on, and noticed Sandra with mud all over her shirt.
 Benjamin's sister apologized to Sandra and scolded Benjamin saying, "Benjamin, apologize!
 Why did you do that?" Benjamin replied yelling, "Because she killed my men and stepped on  castle!" Sandra then noticed she was standing right on his toy soldiers. Sandra then apologized  and Benjamin's sister began to laugh at her and said, "Don't worry about it! I'm Jessica. What's  your name?" The two began talking. It was the beginning of a new friendship.

289. FINGERPRINTING
 Karla had just moved to the city and enrolled her eight-year-old son Gavin in a new school.
 Karla used to be a very active participant in the school community. She always volunteered in the  classroom, went to Parent-Teacher Association meetings, and chaperone on class trips. Karla  wanted to do the same thing at the new school her son was attending. She felt it was a good  example for Gavin, and it helped her be more in tune with whatever was going on at the school.
 The new school, however, had different rules. Karla couldn't just show up in the classroom  and offer to help. She couldn't even offer to chaperone on class trips. District regulations required  her to be fingerprinted. The school district would then run a background check on Karla based on  the fingerprints. The school district had very strict rules about allowing people with criminal  convictions to volunteer in the school.
 While it didn't cost Karla anything to get fingerprinted, the fingerprinting office had very limited  hours. She also couldn't just walk in when it was convenient for her. She had to make an  appointment. The fingerprinting office was also located very far from where Karla lived. She would  have to take two buses to get there.
 Karla also had to get a tuberculosis test. The TB test was easy. It was just a little prick on her  lower arm but this required another separate appointment at a separate location. The test didn't  cost Karla anything, but again, the office where she had to go was far.
 Karla understood that the school district wants children to be safe and healthy, but she also  felt they were making it hard for parents.

290. GETTING CABLE
 Anthony wanted to get cable television for the new apartment he rented with his wife and  children. He especially was interested in seeing channels from his home country. He called the  local cable company to sign up. There were many options for Anthony to choose from. The basic  service was the least expensive, but it didn't include any of the channels from his country. So  Anthony signed up for a package that included channels from his country. However, that package  didn't include cartoon channels that his children liked to see. So he added an expanded package  to include cartoon channels. That still left out channels that showed certain series that his wife  liked to see. So Anthony signed up for a special promotion that included a premium channel for  one month free.
 The customer service representative set an appointment to send a technician to Anthony's  house in a week. The appointment wasn't for an exact time. Instead the customer service  representative said the technician would come between noon and 2:00 in the afternoon. When the  technician arrived, he set up a converter box and digital recorder box to the family television in the  living room. The technician gave Anthony a remote and a channel guide. Anthony had to sign  some papers before the technician left.
 Anthony, his wife, and their children enjoyed the hundreds of channels they now had thanks to  cable. One month after the technician came and installed all of the equipment, a bill arrived. The  bill totaled almost 200 dollars. Anthony could not afford to pay that much on a monthly basis. He  discussed it with his wife. They decided not to keep the channels from their country and the  premium channels his wife enjoyed. The only extra channels Anthony kept were the cartoon  channels for his kids.

291. TRASH DAYS
 Frank just moved from an apartment into a small house with his family. When he lived in a six story apartment building, dealing with the trash was easy. Frank usually just dropped a bag of  garbage down a trash compactor chute. There was one trash compactor chute on every floor of  the building. The chute was in a small room located next to the elevator._ Frank had to take cans,  bottles, and other recyclables to the basement and put them in a special bin. He did not though  have to worry about remembering what day was trash day. He did not have to worry about taking  the trash out to be collected. That was the job of the building's superintendent.
 The two-bedroom house Frank moved into had no superintendent though. Frank was  provided with three trashcans by the city. Each trashcan was a different color. The black one was  for regular garbage. The blue one was for paper, plastic, and cans so that they could be recycled.
 The green bin was for leaves, cut grass, and tree trimmings. Each bin needed to be put out to the  curb before the city sanitation trucks came around early Monday morning. Frank couldn't put the  cans out too early, either. If he put the cans on the curb before 6:00 p.m. on Sunday evenings, he  could get a ticket and have to pay a fine.
 Frank decided to set a reminder on his cell phone. Every Sunday night at 6:00 in the evening  his phone would beep reminding him to take the trash bins to the curb. Frank also had to pay the  city every three months for trash collection. That was something that he didn't have to do when he  rented an apartment. Living in a house sure involved a lot more responsibility than living in an  apartment building.

292. SEEING A DERMATOLOGIST
 Andrea's acne was getting worse by the day. Not only did it not look good, but it made her feel  self-conscious. She wanted to go see a dermatologist about her skin condition. Andrea had health  insurance through her job. When she signed up for the health plan, she chose a primary care  physician. That doctor would take care of Andrea's basic health needs. The primary care  physician was not a dermatologist though. If Andrea wanted the health insurance to pay for the  dermatologist, she first needed to make an appointment with her regular physician. Otherwise,  Andrea would have to pay out of her own pocket to see a dermatologist.
 Andrea called her primary care provider. She had to wait a week for an appointment since her  acne was not an emergency. When it was time for the appointment, she showed her doctor the  acne problem. Her primary care physician was able to prescribe a skin cream for her. Andrea  used that skin cream for a week, but her acne did not get any better. She called her doctor back.
 The doctor couldn't do anything else for her. So the doctor gave her a referral to see a skin  specialist, a dermatologist.
 Andrea called the dermatologist, but she had to wait another three weeks for an appointment.
 Her acne had gotten worse over these three weeks. When she finally saw the dermatologist, he  ran a number of blood tests and allergy tests. The dermatologist told Andrea that the acne was  actually an allergic reaction to fried foods. Andrea thought it was a lot of trouble to finally find out  what was wrong. She was happy though now that she knew all she had to do was not to eat fried  food, which was not good for her waistline or her skin.

294. LEARNING TO DRIVE
 One of the greatest moments in a young person's life is the day when he or she starts learning  to drive. Learning to drive is a rite of passage. It is one of the steps young people take to develop  into adulthood. This is a wondrous time full of excitement and expectations. One of the most  attractive things about learning to drive is the freedom that comes from operating a vehicle.
 Once people are able to drive a vehicle, they can go anywhere in the city and beyond. In  Southern California, the region was planned and built in a spread-out fashion with miles and miles  of freeway access. A new driver no longer needs to rely on others to go somewhere. He or she is  now free to go out on their own.
 When Michael Allen first learned to drive, he was so excited. He was 16 years old, which in  California means he can get a driver's permit. After six months with a permit, he could have a  license to drive. Michael had been pestering his father to teach him how to drive for months and  now came the big day. His father Edward was a big strong man, who insisted on teaching Michael  on a standard transmission car. That meant Michael had to learn how to operate a clutch and gear  shifter, which is not easy.
 The two began their lessons. Edward was a difficult task-master, and Michael was having  great difficulty at first. "Let the clutch out slowly," Edward began yelling every time Michael didn't  do it correctly. "Ease it through. You can do it," said Edward to his son. "I'm trying, dad. I'm trying,"  said Michael. It was not pleasant at first, but soon Michael was driving up and down the block. He  was very pleased, and so was his dad. Michael was now a driver.

295. PLAYING FOOTBALL
 Spring finally arrived. This past winter was a long, cold, and snowy one. Gonzalo was ready to  get outdoors and play some sports. However, since Gonzalo was new in town, he didn't have that  many friends. He decided to try and get some of his co-workers together. In the company  lunchroom he put up a paper. The paper invited people to meet Gonzalo at a nearby park on  Saturday for a game of football. Football was Gonzalo's favorite sport. He played it ever since he  was a kid.
 On Saturday morning, Gonzalo was excited to go to the park with his new friends to play  some football. He was a little worried that people wouldn't show up. Gonzalo walked to the park  early. He wanted to be the first one there to meet everyone. He packed his cleats and a ball in a  backpack.
 Gonzalo waited in an open field close to the entrance to the park. That way everyone could  see him. He would also be preventing others from taking the space. Slowly but surely, Gonzalo's  coworkers began coming into the park. Some of them even brought friends and family from  outside of work. Gonzalo was certain they would have a great game.
 "I brought a ball," Gonzalo told one of his coworkers Leo, who said he had also brought a ball.
 Leo said he was a huge football fan. Sometimes Leo even held parties at his house to watch  football. Both Leo and Gonzalo went to their backpacks to get their balls. That's when they  realized there had been a miscommunication.
 Leo's ball was oblong and brown, while Gonzalo's ball was a round soccer ball. Gonzalo had  forgotten that in the United States football and soccer were different sports. Leo had forgotten  that, too. They compromised and played one game of soccer and one game of American football.

296. FOOD TRUCKS
 Food trucks used to be somewhere fast to get meals for office workers in cities across the  United States. The food used to be just average, certainly nothing to boast about. Food trucks  were a matter of convenience, and usually offered inexpensive meals. At lunchtime in cities  across the United States, workers lined up to order a sandwich and a canned soda. The meal  rarely cost more than five dollars. They took their food and ate as they walked. Some workers  would take their food back to their offices and eat in the company lunchroom or at their desks.
 Food trucks have come a long way. They are no longer thought of as just fast food on wheels.
 Now food trucks are considered a gourmet dining experience. There are food trucks selling  cuisine from all over the world. There are Korean barbecue food trucks and food trucks that sell  lobster rolls. There are even food trucks that specialize in desserts. These dessert food trucks sell  more than just ice-cream cones. They sell cakes and pies. There're even cupcake trucks.
 Food trucks have become so popular that many use social media to reach customers and  create a fan base. Some food trucks use Twitter to let customers know what their menu is for the  day. Other food trucks use Facebook to let customers know on what corner they will be parked.
 These clean food trucks, with their gourmet food and large fan base, are not a bargain  anymore though. Rarely can you get a meal from a food truck for less than ten dollars. Some  people think the price is worth the quality. Others just bring sandwiches from home.

297. THE GREAT NELSON MANDELA
 Nelson Mandela was a South African anti-Apartheid activist, and human rights advocate,  whose life had a profound effect on American culture. Mandela served as president of South  Africa from 1994 through 1999, but his story began decades earlier. His life's work was to bring  South Africa into mainstream 20th Century thinking by ending Apartheid.
 Apartheid was a system of South African government that was based on racial segregation  between the minority white population and black South Africans. It was a controversial form of  government that was in effect from 1948 to 1994, and caused great social turmoil. The system  was put into place following World War II, but racial segregation began much earlier in the country.
 Apartheid separated South Africans by race by placing people into four classifications: white,  black, coloured, and Indian. Each group had different levels of privilege, with white South Africans  being the most favored.
 From 1960 to 1983, 3.5 million black South Africans were forcibly removed from their homes;  in 1970, all non-white politicians were removed from government. Mandela's move to end  Apartheid began in 1949 when he supported, and organized non-violent boycotts, strikes, and civil  disobedience. He was arrested, and charged with treason in 1956 for his role in the social  uprising, and was eventually jailed for 27 years. During this time, most of the countries in the  world called for his release, and placed trade embargos against the white regime.
 The country finally gave in to international pressure, and released Mandela. He became an  international symbol for peaceful demonstration, and for his humanitarian work and perseverance.
 He was elected President of South Africa in 1994, serving for six years. Mandela died in  December, 2013.

298. CHARLES DARWIN
 One of the most influential figures in human history is Charles Darwin. Darwin has been called  the father of evolution for his work in evolutionary science. In the United States, Darwin has  become the symbol for atheists in the country as his theory of evolution smacks in the face of  creationism. His theory claims that all of earth's species have descended from their ancestors,  and that they have adapted to their surroundings throughout history. It also claims that every  species has a common ancestor. Darwin introduced his theory in his landmark book On the Origin  of Species in 1859.
 His book was met with suspicion from both the scientific community and the general public,  but by the 1870s, his work was beginning to gain mass acceptance. One of his most significant  studies came when he sailed with the HMS Beagle, a British sea vessel, to the Galapagos  Islands. The islands have been long isolated from the South American mainland, and provided  him with a unique insight on the process of evolution.
 While sailing from island to island, Darwin noticed similarities between island species and  mainland species. Most were similar in many ways, but some had subtle differences. He also  found that the same species had differences from island to island. To Darwin it was clear that the  reason for the slight differences was the individual environment of each island. These islands  showed Darwin the evolution process in the making.
 Darwin has many critics from religious circles. A very famous caricature of Darwin depicting  him as a half-human monkey was published in 1871 in response to his theory that humans  evolved from ape-like creatures. He spawned a movement of non-believers called Darwinism,  which includes people who feel his theories are rooted in the scientific method as opposed to  religious dogma.

299. ONLINE CLASSES
 Barbara dropped out of college 17 years ago when she had her first daughter. She always  regretted dropping out. She had been a good student, and enjoyed going to classes in college.
 However, when she had her daughter, she didn't have time to continue with her studies. She  needed to find a full-time job.
 Barbara also regretted dropping out of college because it was hard to find a good job without  a college degree. While Barbara was lucky enough to always find work, some of the jobs she had  didn't pay well. Most of them didn't offer benefits like vacation pay and health insurance. Barbara  was sure that if she had a college degree, finding a better-paying job with benefits would be  easier.
 Barbara's daughter was now a teenager. She was beginning to look at colleges. This inspired  Barbara to go back to school herself. Barbara wanted to finally get her bachelor's degree. Since  her daughter was in high school, Barbara had more time. She didn't have to constantly watch over  her daughter. However, even as a teenager, Barbara's daughter still needed to eat and needed  clothes, so going to college on a regular schedule was not an option for Barbara.
 Barbara went to the local community college to learn about her options. A college counselor  told her that she could take online classes to finish her degree. Barbara was worried that these  classes wouldn't give the same credit as a traditional college class would. The counselor told her  the credits were the same, and online classes were good for non-traditional students like her.
 Barbara enrolled and became a student again.

300. THE TITANIC
 One of the world's greatest tragedies was the sinking of the luxury liner Titanic. Although it  was a British ship, many Americans were on board during that terrible night of April 15, 1912. The  ship was on its maiden voyage on that night when it struck an iceberg in the deep waters of the  North Atlantic Ocean. The ship was in route to New York City from Southampton, UK when it hit  the iceberg, killing more than 1,500 of the 2,224 passengers. The ship was the largest ship ever  built to that date, and was thought to be unsinkable.
 The ship's passengers varied from some of the richest people in the world at the time, to  thousands of immigrant workers who were trying to find work in the United States. The Titanic was  equipped with technological safety features like remote control watertight doors, and watertight  compartments, but it did not carry enough lifeboats for all passengers. Because of the immense  size of the ship, it was thought to be unsinkable, a fact that contributed to the small number of  lifeboats carried on the ship. Additionally, many of the lifeboats were not filled to capacity when  they were launched, causing more loss of life.
 Most of those killed that night were men. The protocol followed by the ship's officers required  "women and children first," when loading lifeboats. The accident was met by international shock  and grief. Many of today's maritime rules were put into place because of this disaster. Only 705  passengers floating on lifeboats were saved that night. The ship broke into two parts before it  went under. It remains more than a mile deep in the North Atlantic. The sinking of the Titanic has  been documented in film and literature over the years.

301. GEORGE WASHINGTON: THE FATHER OF THE
 COUNTRY  There may be no greater American than George Washington. Washington became  the first United States President in 1789 with his unanimous victory in the first  American election. He was also unanimously elected to a second term in 1793, the  only president ever to garner 100 percent of the electoral votes. Washington was also  the Commander-in-Chief of the First Continental Army that fought the British when  the country was not yet established.
 His epic "Crossing of the Delaware" river to recover New York City is still  considered one of the greatest military moves in the history of warfare. At the time of  the crossing, the British had taken Boston and New York. The Continental Army was  on the run and disorganized, but Washington had a plan. He decided to take his  troops across the Delaware River in the middle of winter. This was a move that many  military minds thought impossible, but not Washington. The Americans were able to  take New Jersey, and change the course of the war.
 Another landmark moment for Washington was the winter at Valley Forge. In  1777, Washington led an army of more than 11,000 troops into Valley Forge in  Pennsylvania, where the army suffered through a cold winter that claimed the lives of  3,000 men. When the spring arrived, instead of a demoralized, beaten group of  soldiers, the army emerged battle ready, and able to continue the fight against the  English in New York. The army was able to survive the fierce winter because of the  training, and preparedness of Washington's officers. Washington earned the  nickname, "The Father of His Country," because of his military intelligence that led to  the birth of the nation.

302. HENRY FORD: THE FOUNDER OF FORD MOTOR
 COMPANY  Henry Ford was an American inventor who is credited with inventing the  automobile assembly line. German automaker, Karl Benz, is credited with inventing  the first motor vehicle in the late 1880s, but Ford was the man who made it possible  for everyday citizens to own one. Before Ford came up with his assembly line  process, cars were built one at a time by hand, which was a very costly and  inefficient method of production. Ford's assembly line revolutionized the way cars  were built, and his methods are still in use today.
 In 1886, Benz patented his Motorwagen, which was a four-wheel, two-passenger,  self-powered motor coach that was designed to replace the horse and carriage. These  vehicles were expertly crafted, but were available to only the wealthiest people of the  time. Thanks to Ford, that all changed in 1906. His Ford Motor Company, the first  automobile company to use assembly line techniques to build cars. transformed the  automobile from an expensive curiosity to a practical tool that could be used to  transport people and goods easily and efficiently. His first mass-produced product  was the Model T. It remains one of the most sold vehicles ever, and was the first to  reach 15 million sales.
 Ford's impact on the 20th Century cannot be overstated. At one time it was  estimated that nine out of 10 vehicles on American roads were Fords. His cars  spurred the American economy like no other single factor. The country's roadways  were built in response to the great number of vehicles Ford and subsequent American  automakers produced. Additionally, Ford's vehicles created a network of support  industries such as parts, repair, and maintenance services. It also caused a revolution  in how goods were transported in the country. Henry Ford was a true American icon.

303. MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.: CIVIL RIGHTS LEADER
 Martin Luther King Jr. is one of the most famous Americans ever. He was a pastor,  and a humanitarian, but is known mostly for being a civil rights activist. King was the  leader of the African-American Civil Rights Movement during the 1950s and 60s. His  use of non-violent protest to affect social change was based on his Christian beliefs.
 King was born Michael King, but his father changed his name in honor of the German  reformer, Martin Luther.
 King lived during the most divisive era in American history. The white and the  southern culture in the United States wanted nothing to do with social change during  the 60s. Segregation laws were in place that prohibited black Americans from eating  at the same restaurants as whites, or to ride in the same section on public buses with  white Americans. King led the famous 1955 Montgomery Bus Boycott in reaction to  Rosa Park's refusal to surrender her bus seat to a white passenger as was required by  law in Montgomery, Alabama at the time.
 King started his activism while serving as a Baptist minister for the Dexter Avenue  Baptist Church. He believed strongly in the Christian belief that loving thy neighbor as  yourself, which was a philosophy he used throughout his civil rights years. He was  also a great speaker. His "I Have a Dream" speech is regarded as one of the most  famous oratory in American history. In it, he speaks of how his dream is for white  and black Americans to walk together hand in hand as brothers. The speech also  declared how it was his dream for all Americans to be judged, not by the color of  their skin, but by the content of their character.
 On October 14, 1964, King was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his involvement  in combating racial inequality in the United States. He was assassinated in April,  1968, in Memphis, Tennessee at the age of 39.

304. BILL GATES: THE MAN BEHIND MICROSOFT
 Bill Gates is an American inventor, computer programmer, philanthropist, and  businessman, who was born in Seattle, Washington. He is reportedly worth nearly  $80 billion, making him one of the wealthiest people in the country. He founded, and  was head of Microsoft Corporation for years, and is still on the board for the computer  software giant.
 Gates was born to an upper-middle class family. His father was an attorney; his  mother was a banker, who worked for the United Way for many years. He is credited  for being the father of the modern computer, and for almost single-handedly starting  the personal computer revolution. He studied at Harvard University, but did not  graduate because of his desire to develop new software.
 As a 13-year-old student at the Lakeside School, which was an exclusive college  preparatory school, Gates was introduced to computer programming. That year he  developed a program that allowed users to play tic-tac-toe against the computer.
 Gates was reportedly fascinated by the computer's ability to reproduce software  code. In 1975, Gates approached a company called Micro Instrumentation and  Telemetry Systems (MITS). He convinced the owner that he had written a program  that would work with his platform. The owner of the company bought into Gates  innovations, and the two men reached an agreement to develop software for MITS.
 The Microsoft Company was born.
 Gates went on to develop the Windows operating system with then partner IBM  Corporation. The two companies had differences though, and their partnership ended  quickly. Gates left Microsoft in 2000, but remains on its board of directors. He  remained active with the company for several years before stepping down in February  2014, becoming Technical Advisor for the firm.

305. MICHAEL JORDAN: A FAMOUS BASKETBALL STAR
 Many American basketball fans would argue that Michael Jordan is by far the  greatest player ever to play in the National Basketball Association. The professional  basketball league has existed since 1947, and there have been many individual  players that have excelled in the game. Players such as Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain,  Kareem Abdul Jabbar, and Jerry West had made their mark in the league long before  Jordan ever played the game.
 To be sure, Jordan had a great impact on the game primarily during his playing  years with the Chicago Bulls. Jordan led the team to six championship finals, winning  all six during the 1990s. His legend is firmly cemented into the history of the great  city, and many fans feel he has no equal. It is hard to argue against Jordan in light of  his success in all the titles he achieved, but basketball is a team sport, and winning a  championship needs a team effort. There have been countless superstars who played  in the league that did not have good teammates, and never won a title. Chamberlain  falls into that category.
 Chamberlain did win two NBA titles in his career, but no one in the game ever  dominated it the way he did. He holds several league records, one of which is that he  is the only player ever to score 100 points in a single game. However, when  Chamberlain played the game, the NBA was not as big as it was in the 90s. During  the 90s, the league enjoyed a much greater popularity among American viewers, and  much of this can be attributed to the greatness of Michael Jordan. Jordan brought a  style of play that had rarely been seen in the NBA. He garnered many individual  awards during his career. He played his last few seasons as a member of the  Washington Bullets.

306. BABE RUTH: THE GREATEST BASEBALL PLAYER
 Arguably the greatest Major League Baseball player of all time is George Herman  Ruth. The "Babe," as he was known, is largely responsible for building the game as it  exists today. The stadium where he played in New York is commonly called "The  House that Ruth Built." Ruth played baseball for 22 years for the Boston Red Sox, and  the New York Yankees, where he rewrote the record books. He almost single handedly invented the home run, which is baseball's most cherished feat. Before  Ruth, the home run was a novelty. It was a game of strategy, but the Babe changed  all that.
 Ruth was born in a rough section of Baltimore, Maryland in 1895. Much of his  childhood has been lost to history. He spent a number of years at St. Mary's  reformatory school after being labeled as "incorrigible." His behavior was thought to  be beyond rehabilitation. When exactly he got his start in baseball is also a mystery.
 Some accounts offer that he was placed on St. Mary's baseball team by the coach of  the time. One popular story has Ruth being sent to the school because of his natural  ability to hit a baseball. The story is that Ruth broke many windows while playing  baseball on the streets, and that is why he was sent to the school in the first place.
 Before the 1920s, baseball was a slow game that included advancing players  around the bases by strategically hitting the ball within the park. Ruth came in and  was soon hitting balls out of the ballpark to the delight of the fans in attendance. The  home run became an integral part of the game. Ruth earned several nicknames  because of his power, including the "Bambino," and the "Sultan of Swat."  When Ruth was traded by the Red Sox to the Yankees in a very unpopular move,  the Yankees won seven World Series championships in his 12 years. Ruth made  headlines for his after-hours antics in New York City as well. His drinking, and  womanizing are well-documented. However, Ruth was a spiritual man who lived-out  his years as a devout Catholic.

307. KOBE BRYANT: THE INCREDIBLE BASKETBALL STAR
 Kobe Bryant is a professional basketball player, who played his entire career with  the Los Angeles Lakers. He first joined the team as a 17-year-old teenager in 1996.
 During the time, Bryant led the Lakers to five National Basketball Association titles.
 The most recent championship was in 2010, when the Lakers beat their arch rival,  the Boston Celtics. The Lakers also won seven western conference titles and eight  Pacific Division titles during Bryant's time.
 The Lakers are one of the most successful teams in the history of the NBA. They  have appeared in 31 championship finals, more than any other teams in the league.
 The team has won more regular season games than any other franchise. It is clearly  one of the premier NBA organizations, which came into existence in 1946.
 Before Bryant, the Lakers already had some of the most notable superstars the  league has ever known. Players such as George Mikan, Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem  Abdul Jabbar, and Magic Johnson. Bryant had been central in establishing, and  maintaining the legacy of this great team. He is the latest, and possible greatest of  them all.
 His individual statistics are astounding. He is the youngest player ever to score  30,000 points. He has been selected to the NBA's All Star team every year he has  played, with the exception of his rookie season. He has won two Olympic Gold Medals  in Basketball, leading the United States Olympic titles in 2008 in Beijing, and in the  London games of 2012. In 2006, Bryant became the 2nd player in the history of the  game to score more than 80 points in a single game. Only Chamberlain has scored  more. He holds several Laker individual records, including most seasons played, most  All Star selections, most points scored, and most playoff games played.

308. TIGER WOODS: A GREAT AMERICAN GOLF
 CHAMPION  Golf is one of the most popular games in the United States today. There have  been many great champions over the years like Arnold Palmer, and Jack Nicklaus, but  none has seen success like Tiger Woods. His father was black; his mother was Thai.
 He was born and lived his early life in Thailand.
 Woods joined the pro golf tour at the age of 20 in 1996, where he began setting  records for winning championships at a young age. He was one of the most promising  young stars to hit the tour in years, which led to Woods acquiring several, lucrative  contracts with Nike, and Titleist. Woods became a very young millionaire. In 2001,  Woods became the first player in history to hold the title in all four major golf  tournaments. It seemed there was nothing this young man could not accomplish.
 Woods grew up in Orange County, California, and studied for two years at  prestigious Stanford University. Woods began playing golf at an early age, and before  long was winning amateur championships regularly. He was the Professional Golfers  Association (PGA) Rookie of the Year in 1996. He has been named PGA Player of the  Year, and PGA Tour Player of the Year, 11 times each. He has also led the tour as the  biggest money winner several years. He was married, and had two children. His life  was presumed ideal, but that changed in 2009.
 Woods was exposed as a womanizer by several women, following an alleged affair  with a New York woman. Woods denied any wrongdoing, but eventually confessed to  several "indiscretions". The controversy kept gaining momentum, and it eventually  led to his divorce and the loss of endorsement money from the sponsors. Woods is  back on the tour, but has not regained his proficiency as before.

309. JESSE OWENS: THE MAN WHO DEFIED HITLER
 During the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin, Germany, Chancellor Adolf Hitler vowed  to use the games to showcase Aryan superiority to the rest of the world. Hitler was  convinced that the white, Aryan male was part of the superior race, and promised his  games would prove this superiority on the Olympic stage. American track and field  athlete, James "Jesse" Owens, had a different idea.
 Owens was an excellent athlete at Ohio State University during the early 1930s.
 During one track meet in 1935, Owens set three world records, and tied another, in  what has been called "the greatest 45 minutes ever in sports." Although Owens found  great success in his athletic career, he grew up during a time in America when black  people were still highly discriminated against. Segregation laws were still in effect in  many parts of the country, and Owens felt this prejudice directly. He was not able to  stay in the same hotel rooms as his white teammates, nor was he allowed to eat at  the same restaurants. Ironically, Owens was treated better during his time at the  36th Olympics in Germany.
 During the games, Hitler became annoyed that Owens was winning so many gold  medals. Owens was proving Hitler's racist claims and rhetoric as untrue. Hitler didn't  like it. Owens ended up winning four gold medals at these games. Hitler refused to  shake his hand. One of the defining moments of the games is when Owens was  befriended by German athlete Luz Long. Owens cherished his friendship with Long,  especially because he knew that Long could fall out of favor with Hitler's brutal  regime.
 Many German fans shook Owen's hands, even though Hitler did not, but when  Owens returned to the United States, he found not much had changed in there.

310. STEVEN SPIELBERG: HOLLYWOOD'S BEST DIRECTOR
 One of the finest Hollywood directors in the history of the film industry is Steven  Allan Spielberg. Spielberg has directed some of the most significant and popular films  in recent Hollywood history. His list of films reads like a who's who in the movie  industry. He has directed such blockbusters as E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Jurassic  Park, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Schindler's List, and Saving Private Ryan.
 Born into a Jewish family on December 18, 1946 in Cincinnati, Ohio, the young  Spielberg showed an interest in filmmaking during his teen years. When he was 12  years old, Spielberg created a nine-minute film to earn his photography badge in the  Boy Scouts. This was the first film he made. His parents divorced when he was 13,  and Spielberg moved with his family to California. After graduating from high school,  he applied to the University of Southern California (USC) to learn filmmaking, but did  not graduate. Instead he attended Long Beach State, where he earned his degree in  Film Production and Electronic Arts, 35 years after first attending college.
 His early work was as a television writer, having written scripts for popular shows  such as Night Gallery, Marcus Welby, M.D., and Columbo in the 70s. His breakthrough  film in Hollywood was 1975's Jaws, which is one of the most popular, highest grossing blockbuster in the history of the Silver Screen. He followed the success of  Jaws with several films that have earned him a spot in Hollywood lore. His films have  become household names.
 Spielberg shows no signs of slowing down. He is involved in several film projects  as a director, and a producer. He has been married twice, and has six children. He  was voted Forbes Magazine's Most Influential Celebrity in America in 2014. His  personal wealth is estimated to be more than $3 billion.

311. MICHAEL JACKSON: A CONTROVERSIAL POP STAR
 There may be no greater entertainer in the history of music in the United States  than the late Michael Jackson. The list of Jackson's peers in the industry is very short,  to say the least. Jackson began his career in the early 1970s as the youngest  member of the musical group The Jackson 5. Michael was the lead singer, and  arguably the most talented of the five brothers who made up the band. He was born  on August 29, 1958 as the eighth child of 10 in an African American family from Gary  Indiana. The driving force behind the group's success was their father, Joseph "Joe"  Jackson. The group was very popular in its time, but young Michael would go out on  his own career soon after. He was a successful singer, songwriter, actor, dancer, and  businessman, but his career was not without controversy.
 His album Thriller is the best-selling album of all time. It was released in 1982,  and was followed by a series of successful albums, films, music videos, and business  ventures. In 1993 the first of several people came forward to accuse Jackson of  sexually improper conduct on a child. This and other accusations would haunt  Jackson throughout his adult life. Jackson also gained a reputation of strange  behavior. One of the indelible images often associated with Jackson is when he held  his newborn child over a hotel balcony to show it to his public.
 It was rumored that Jackson bought the bones of the famous Elephant Man, slept  in an oxygen tent, and that he altered his appearance to appear white. His  photographs from his childhood and as a young adult show a very different Jackson.
 He married twice in his life including a brief marriage to Lisa Marie Presley, the  daughter of the equally great musician, Elvis Presley.
 Jackson died on June 25, 2009, and even his death was not without controversy.
 His family filed a wrongful death lawsuit against his doctor, who was subsequently  found guilty.

312. MICKEY MOUSE: THE WORLD FAMOUS CARTOON
 CHARACTER  There is perhaps no greater American cartoon character than the world famous  Mickey Mouse. Mickey Mouse is a creation of the late Walt Disney, who pioneered the  age of theme parks into popular, American culture. Today, Mickey is the official  mascot of the Walt Disney Corporation. He is what is called an anthropomorphic  character, which is a term used to describe a non-human character that has human  characteristics. Mickey can speak, laugh, cry, and use his hands like a human. He  also walks on two legs rather than four. His trademark red shorts, large yellow shoes,  white gloves, and over-sized mouse ears make him one of the most recognizable  cartoon characters in America, and in the world.
 Mickey was created by Disney in 1928 in the short film Steamboat Willie. That film  was the first of 130 films starring the famous mouse. He has also starred in 10 full length, feature films. In the 1930s, Mickey began to appear in comic books, and on  November 18, 1978 he got his own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. He became  the first cartoon character to earn a star on the historic sidewalk. Ten of his films  have been nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film with Lend  a Paw winning the award. Walt Disney received an Honorary Award for creating the  character in 1932.
 One of the most popular children's shows in American history was the "Mickey  Mouse Club," which ran from 1955 to 1996. Mickey has a girlfriend named Minnie  Mouse, a dog named Pluto, and a host of friends that include Donald, and Daisy  Duck, who are stars on their own.
 Today, Mickey Mouse merchandise can be found world wide. He appears in all  Disney theme parks throughout the world. In 1988 Mickey made his last full-length  film appearance when he starred in Who Framed Roger Rabbit. This was a significant  occurrence because it was the first time that Disney characters starred alongside  Warner Brother's characters. The two corporations had been long-time rivals.

313. JACKIE ROBINSON: BREAKING THE COLOR LINE
 There was a time in the United States when black people were not allowed to play  the game of baseball with white players. That was before the great Jackie Robinson  broke what was called the color line in baseball. Prior to April 15, 1947, Major League  Baseball was an exclusive "whites only" organization that barred black players from  participation. Black Americans could only play in the Negro Leagues that existed  roughly between 1920 through 1948. Robinson, and the Brooklyn Dodgers, put an  end to segregation in baseball that year, and began a movement for racial equality in  the United States.
 Robinson was born in Cairo, Georgia on January 31, 1919, but grew up in  Pasadena, California, near Los Angeles. He was an outstanding athlete who played  baseball and football for Pasadena City College, then at the University of California at  Los Angeles (UCLA). During his time with the Dodgers, the team won one  championship, and appeared in the World Series six times. From 1949 to 1954,  Robinson was named to the All-Star Team, and he won the National League Most  Valuable Player Award. He was also named the Baseball Rookie of the Year in 1947,  the first year the award was given.
 Today, Robinson is honored by every team in both the National and American  Leagues on Jackie Robinson Day. On that day, all MLB players wear the number 42 in  honor of Robinson. That number, used to be worn by Robinson, was retired  universally by all baseball teams, making it the first time any league has retired a  number. No player on any MLB team can ever wear that number again. Robinson was  inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1962. He died on October 24, 1972, and was  posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Congressional Gold  Medal for his part in changing American society.

314. VAN HALEN: FROM GARAGE BAND TO
 SUPERSTARDOM  Van Halen is to Rock 'n' Roll as Cadillac is to automobiles. It is one of the most  popular bands ever to perform in the country, and is still going strong 40 years later.
 It is known as one of the best bands ever to come from a garage-band background.
 Founded by brothers Eddie and Alex Van Halen in their home in Pasadena, California  in 1972, the band was one of the top rock acts in the country, and is as popular today  as it was back then.
 Eddie Van Halen is considered one of the best lead guitarists in the history of  music by many of his peers, while Alex was a superior drummer. Together, they  formed the nucleus of the popular band that also included bass guitarist, Michael  Anthony, and vocalist, David Lee Roth. The brothers were born in the Netherlands,  and immigrated to the United States when they were children. The two were  inseparable, and developed an interest in music in the mid-60s. They formed the  band in 1972, using the name Genesis. They later changed the name to Mammoth  when Eddie discovered Genesis was already in use. Eventually they renamed the  band Van Halen.
 According to popular legend, Van Halen was discovered by Gene Simmons of the  rock band Kiss, while they were performing at Gazzarri's on the Strip, a popular spot  for heavy metal rock bands in the 70s. They continued to play at gigs throughout  Southern California when they released their self-titled debut album Van Halen in  1978. The album peaked at No. 19 on the Billboard list, and the band never looked  back. Van Halen's greatest commercial success was from 1978 through 1985, but  their albums continue to sell. It has garnered a cult-like following from several,  younger generations of American Rock 'n' Roll fans.

315. JANE FONDA: AMERICAN PATRIOT OR TRAITOR?
 One of the most divisive eras in American history is the Vietnam era. The Vietnam  era for the United States ran roughly from 1960 through 1975. In the mid to late 60s,  America's involvement became a huge issue. The conflict in Vietnam was divisive for  many reasons, but mostly because of the public's perception that it was an immoral  and illegal operation. The other major factor was that the U.S. was still engaged in  drafting young men into the service of the country against their will.
 One of Hollywood's major film stars of the time was Jane Fonda. Fonda came from  Hollywood movie royalty, being the daughter of the great actor, Henry Fonda. She  won two Oscars, seven Golden Globe awards, and an Emmy award through her long  career. In the 60s she was a political activist who was against the war in Vietnam.
 She was very outspoken against the conflict, as many celebrities were at the time.
 In 1970, Fonda made headlines for a very different reason. She and two fellow  actors starred in an anti-war film that drew much controversy. In July of 1972, Fonda  drew the wrath of many Americans when she was photographed sitting with North  Vietnamese Army members on an anti-aircraft gun. That image soiled her reputation  as an actress, and as a true American. Many called Fonda a traitor for interacting with  the enemy. Years later, Fonda said that she was manipulated into taking that photo,  but many Americans still have their doubts.
 During her trip to North Vietnam, which was at war with the U.S. backed South  Vietnam, Fonda made a number of radio broadcasts denouncing America's  involvement in the war. This further cemented her image as a traitor. However, there  are many Americans who feel she was a true patriot because she refused to stand  still and spoke out against the war.

316. BARRY BONDS: CHEATER OR LEGEND?
 Baseball is the oldest major league sport in the United States today. With the  growing popularity of American football and basketball, baseball now must share the  limelight with these sports. During the late 1990s, baseball was in trouble.
 Attendance was down. High profile sports that featured fast-paced action such as  football and basketball were stealing baseball's thunder. That was all before Barry  Bonds and a couple of other sluggers brought the game back to center stage.
 Bonds played the first part of his career with the Pittsburgh Pirates, where he  enjoyed moderate success. After being traded to the San Francisco Giants in 1992,  Bonds began a second career that put him into the spotlight for both the right and  wrong reasons. At an age when most players begin to decline in performance  because of their advancing age, Bonds went on a home run tear that was  unprecedented in the history of the game.
 Bonds never hit more than 34 home runs in one year for the Pirates, but, playing  for the Giants, he hit an astounding 73 home runs in 2001. This shattered a record  that had stood for 40 years. Bonds was 38 years old by the end of the 2001 season,  and many questioned how he could put up numbers like that. The answer to that  question came out years later when Bonds was accused of taking illegal,  performance-enhancing drugs. Bonds eventually broke Henry Aaron's record for most  home runs in a career, but many baseball purists feel that the record is tainted  because of the illegal drug use.
 Bonds' post baseball career has been damaged because of the drug use, and  Major League Baseball has implemented a drug use policy since his retirement. He  was indicted by a federal grand jury on charges of perjury for lying about his drug  use, but was able to strike a deal to stay out of jail. In any event, his legacy is  forever soiled.

317. MIKE TYSON: THE YOUNGEST BOXING CHAMP
 Boxing is big in America. The history of the sport precedes the establishment of  the United States by thousands of years. The ancient Greeks are said to have  included a form of boxing as far back as 600 BC. The modern sport of boxing can be  traced to the 16th Century when it became a popular sport in Great Britain. Today,  the sport still uses a variation of the Marquess of Queensberry rules that were  established in 1867. Boxing is the purest form of competition. It pits one man, or  woman, against another in an enclosed ring with only the person's fists as weapons.
 Early matches in the United States featured bare-knuckle fighting, but today boxers  use protective gloves.
 One of the most successful boxers in America is Mike Tyson. Tyson holds several  boxing records. The greatest is possibly when he became the youngest boxer ever to  win the heavyweight championship in three different boxing organizations. Tyson was  just over 20 years old when he accomplished this feat. He was one of the most feared  fighters of his time. Tyson won a total of 50 fights with 44 of those victories coming  by knockout.
 Twelve of Tyson's knockouts came in the first round, which earned him the  nickname of Iron Mike. Eventually, his advancing age and fast living took their toll on  Tyson. By the early 90s, his career was virtually over. Even though his boxing career  lasted until 2002, Tyson was never the same. He went on to a brief acting career,  most notably in the popular 2009 comedy hit The Hangover.
 Tyson's post-boxing career had its ups and downs. He appeared on Barbara  Walter's talk show with his wife, television actress Robin Givens, where Givens called  Tyson a manic-depressive, and that living with him was pure torture. Tyson was  arrested in 1991 for raping an 18-year-old girl, and spent several years in jail. He has  attempted several comebacks, but has never regained his old glory.

318. BARACK OBAMA: AMERICA'S FIRST BLACK
 PRESIDENT  Since 2008, Barack Obama has been president of the United States of America.
 He is a historic figure primarily because he is the first African American to hold the  position of president. His policies have gained him many supporters, as well as many  detractors. He is possibly one of the most divisive presidents to govern the country in  the history of the United States. Obama is a representative of the Democratic Party  with his presidency coming after the controversial George W. Bush left office.
 One of the defining aspects of his presidency is the Patient Protection and  Affordable Care Act, commonly and inaccurately called Obamacare. This act, passed  into law by the U.S. Congress and signed by the president in March 2010, became  effective on January 1, 2014. It is the single, most significant change in government  healthcare since Medicare was implemented in 1965. This act was intended to  increase the affordability of care for Americans, expand insurance coverage, and  lower the uninsured rate in the country. It is a controversial act that has many  detractors, but most Americans now carry health insurance, which was not true  before 2014.
 Obama was born in Honolulu, Hawaii in 1961. He is a graduate of both Columbia  University in New York City, and Harvard Law School. Before becoming president, he  served as senator for the state of Illinois. He is considered a liberal by many southern  conservatives, but this may be an unfair label. The perception is largely due to the  Affordable Care Act, and his attempts at immigration reform. Additionally, Obama  ended the U.S. involvement in the Iraq war. He also ordered the military operation  that eventually resulted in the death of Osama Bin Laden. Obama was reelected as  president in November, 2012.

319. YAO MING: BIGGER THAN LIFE
 Yao Ming is one of the most influential individuals ever to live in the United States  of America. So, how does a 22-year-old Chinese male, born in Shanghai, become an  international superstar, who changes the way both cultures look at each other? Ming  stands 7'6", which makes him one of the tallest players ever to play the game, but  that is not the extent of his power. Ming is tall, and talented.
 Ming started his career in China, where he played for the Shanghai Sharks of the  Chinese Basketball Association. That was the season when the Sharks won a CBA  championship. He was able to negotiate a release from his contract with the Sharks,  making him eligible for the National Basketball Association draft in 2002. Ming was  one of the most sought-after players ever to come from China, and he was eventually  drafted by the Houston Rockets.
 Ming found moderate success in the NBA. His size and strength made him a  formidable presence. He was so big and talented that he could dominate any game  just by being on the court. Ming led the Rockets to the team's first playoff  appearance in several years, but his statistical totals were not so impressive. Still,  Ming was one of the most popular players in NBA history. The fans loved him, and  voted him into the All-Star game eight times.
 Ming did create some degree of resentment from other players, most notably  Shaquille O'Neal from the Los Angeles Lakers. O'Neal was one of the most dominant  players in the game for a brief number of years, and in 2003, Ming outvoted O'Neal in  an NBA fan vote by more than 250,000 votes. This angered O'Neal, who vowed to  outplay Ming whenever the two giants met on the court.

320. OPRAH WINFREY: HER INCREDIBLE LIFE
 Oprah Winfrey is one of the most successful women in the history of the United  States of America. Winfrey was born in a small town in Mississippi in 1954 into a poor  family. She is now one of the richest people in the world, and the richest black  Americans in the country. She was also named as the richest African American in the  20th Century. Winfrey is known to most Americans through her daytime show called  "The Oprah Winfrey Show." Her show is very popular among television viewers  because she likes to tackle the tough issues many other daytime TV hosts avoid.
 Winfrey's early life was difficult. She lived with her mother and grandmother at  times. While living with her grandmother, she learned to read by the age of three,  and had memorized many bible passages. Her mother was an unwed teenager at the  time of her birth, and had a difficult time raising her. Winfrey had two half-sisters.
 One died young as a result of cocaine addiction, and she did not learn about her  other sister until 2010. Winfrey also was not certain who her father was.
 Winfrey suffered from sexual abuse from her uncle, cousin, and family friend, and  became pregnant at 14. She lost her baby shortly after birth though. Winfrey  survived her early years, and at 17 won a local beauty contest before getting her first  break in the media industry as a radio newscaster. This was her first step into the  media market.
 Her show began in Chicago in 1983, and within a few years, it became the No. 1  daytime, talk show in the country. She has interviewed some of the most famous  people in the country on her popular show. Winfrey starred in the movie The Color  Purple, and now owns her own production company called Harpo Films. She is a  philanthropist who is famous for her generosity, and remains one of the most  influential Americans in the country.

321. ABRAHAM LINCOLN: AMERICA'S GREATEST
 PRESIDENT  Abraham Lincoln is a name that is forever embedded into the collective conscience  of every American. It is perhaps the most recognizable name in the history of the  country even as his death occurred approximately 150 years ago. Lincoln presided  over the country during, what is perhaps, the most divisive era in its history. Lincoln  served as president for only four short years, but his impact on the country at the  time, and today, has been huge.
 During his presidency, the United States was in the middle of a terrible civil war.
 At the center of the split between the two sides was slavery. The north was a fast growing, industrial region that was more progressive than their southern counterpart.
 The southern economy was based on cotton production that mostly used forced labor.
 The north viewed this practice as unethical, and immoral, while southerners claimed  it was an integral part of their culture. When Lincoln won the election, the southern  states began to secede from the Union, and the war began.
 Lincoln vowed to end slavery during his campaign for president, while never  speaking about how the country would keep its relationship with the southern states  when slavery was ended. This angered many southerners who promised to rebel if  Lincoln won. The war lasted four years, and about 620,000 soldiers died. In what is  considered the turning point of the war, Lincoln issued his famous Emancipation  Proclamation in January 1863. What it did was gain international favor from the world  because of its ethical qualities. It put pressure on those countries doing business with  the south to review their practices. It effectively put an end to the war. Lincoln was  assassinated on April 15, 1865 by a southern sympathizer as he sat in a theater with  his wife.

322. MUHAMMAD ALI: THE GREATEST BOXER
 The greatest boxer of the modern era is Muhammad Ali. There is generally no  question about this in the boxing circles. However, there are those who would argue  that there were others who were just as great. Ali was born in Louisville, Kentucky,  and was first called Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr., but changed his name in the late  1960s after adopting Islam as his religion.
 Ali was not only one of the greatest heavyweight boxers ever to step into the ring,  but also a deeply spiritual person who defied the United States government by  standing on his ethics. He was a controversial and divisive man who elicited great  emotion from those who loved him, and those who wanted him jailed.
 Ali was on top of his profession in the late 60s when his draft classification was  changed. He was ordered to enlist in the Army, but he refused. He claimed that he  could not go to war because of his religious convictions. Many saw this move by the  U.S. government as a way to silence the outspoken boxer because he was well  beyond the age most young American men were being drafted at the time. Ali was  stripped of his title, and was banned from boxing, while his case went through the  U.S. court system. Ali was inactive during his ablest years from the age 25 to almost  29. There is no telling how many more victories and titles he could have won during  his stolen prime.
 Eventually, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in an 8 - 0 decision in Ali's favor,  overturning his conviction of draft evasion. His stance was not popular at the time  among conservative Americans; many people disliked him very much, but his  determination and moral principles held up his decision. He is now regarded as one of  the most influential persons in the history of the U.S. He was named "Sportsman of  the Century" by Sports Illustrated magazine, and "Sports Personality of the Century"  by the BBC.

323. CARL SAGAN: VISIONARY ASTRONOMER
 Carl Sagan was possibly the most famous American astronomer ever. He was an  astronomer, scientist, author, cosmologist, and television host. His landmark show  "Cosmos" was one of the first science shows to gain acceptance by the general public  in the United States. Sagan challenged Americans to think about their place in the  universe like no other person before him. Using the scientific method, Sagan  challenged long-held beliefs about the genesis of life on earth. This he has done to  the enlightened scientific community, and to the anger of the religious community.
 Many of Sagan's teachings contradict the creationist belief of the beginning of life. He  was also interested in the search for life beyond the planet earth, and participated in  the only human message sent into space intended for an alien race.
 Sagan was born in Brooklyn, New York on November 9, 1934. His interest in  science began at an early age. He wrote and co-wrote 20 books, and had more than  600 scientific research papers published. His most popular work was "Contact", which  tells the story of first contact with an intelligent alien species. The book was made  into a movie in 1997 starring Jodie Foster. The book and movie angered many  religious groups because of its message that human beings are not alone in the  universe.
 Sagan earned his bachelor's and master's degrees in physics from the University  of Chicago in the 1950s. His scientific curiosity led him into developing the television  series "Cosmos". It was one of the most watched science series, and has been  recreated and is currently on the air. His work on the Galileo project lives on today.
 The spacecraft is speeding its way through infinite space today with his message of  greeting to whatever race of beings finds it. Sagan died at the age of 62 from  complications resulting from pneumonia.

324. BEYONCE KNOWLES: BEAUTY AND TALENT
 PERSONIFIED  Beyonce Knowles is an American singer, songwriter, and performer, who was born  in Houston, Texas in 1981. She is one of the biggest female stars on the American  music scene today. Knowles began her singing career in her hometown of Houston as  a child. She was encouraged by her parents to cultivate her musical talents, and her  parents are still a big part of her life. Her father serves as her personal manager,  while her mother designs many of the costumes she wears on her concert tours, and  in her music videos.
 She first found fame as a member of the R&B group Destiny's Child, which was  one of the most popular girl groups in the history of American music. Beyonce began  her solo career during her time with Destiny's Child. After their break-up in 2005, the  artist went completely solo. She found instant success in the music industry because  of her unbridled enthusiasm for her work. She is a tireless worker, and a talented  musician. Knowles is also one of the most beautiful women in the music industry.
 Beyonce won her first award at the age of seven while in elementary school. By  the age of eight, Beyonce, along with two childhood friends, auditioned for an all-girls  group. The group won the competition, and was featured on "Star Search", a popular,  American talent search show of the time. Although the group did not win the Star  Search competition, Beyonce and the original members of Destiny's Child had their  start.
 Some of Beyonce's biggest hits were Deja Vu, Irreplaceable, and Beautiful Liar.
 She has won many awards, including nine American Music Awards, 16 BET Awards,  and 18 Billboard Music Awards. In all, Beyonce has won more than 262 awards, and  has been nominated for 361.

325. JACK KEVORKIAN: HERO OR MURDERER?
 One of the most controversial figures in the history of the United States of  America was Dr. Jack Kevorkian. He was a pathologist, euthanasia advocate, and  author, who came into fame during the late 1990s. He died in 2011. Kevorkian was a  firm believer in euthanasia for the terminally ill. He designed a suicide machine that  helped 130 people end their lives. Kevorkian was persecuted throughout his career as  a suicide facilitator, and was convicted in 1999 for his involvement in an assisted  suicide. He served eight years in prison, and was released in 2007 after agreeing to  no longer assist with anyone's suicide.
 Kevorkian had a difficult time working as a pathologist at the University of  Michigan, where he earned his doctorate degree. He did not see eye to eye with his  employers, and chose to leave the hospital to pursue his own interests. In 1987,  Kevorkian purchased advertising space in Detroit newspapers as a "death  consultant." His first known assisted suicide was for a 54-year-old woman who  suffered from advanced Alzheimer's disease. Kevorkian was not charged in the case  because Michigan did not have a law in place regarding assisted suicide. The state did  file murder charges initially, but those charges were dropped. The Michigan Medical  Board, however, did strip Kevorkian of his medical practitioner's license.
 Kevorkian defended himself at subsequent trials by claiming he took no action to  assist in his patient's suicide. He had invented a machine that was designed to be  operated by the patient using the machine. Therefore, Kevorkian argued he had no  hand in causing the death of his patients. His patients had complete control of the  suicide from start to finish. Kevorkian's role in the deaths was to simply help attach  his patients to his machine. The rest was up to them. Some called Kevorkian a raging  madman who lost his mind, while others called him an angel for helping to end the  suffering of his patients.

326. AMELIA EARHART: AMERICA'S LOST HEROINE
 There is perhaps no greater mystery in the annals of American history as that of  the Amelia Earhart story. Earhart's story is one of controversy, and intriguing. She  was an accomplished aviator, the first woman to fly across the Atlantic Ocean solo.
 She accomplished this during a time when women were not highly regarded in the  United States. American women during the 1930s did not have the same advantages  men had. There were few employment opportunities. Educated women were a  scarcity. Women who did find employment during this era were working as grade school teachers, nannies, and maids for the most part. Amelia Earhart did a lot to  change that perception.
 Although Earhart was born into a family that did see financial success, but that  success was fleeting. There were times in her life when her family struggled to make  ends meet because of poor money management. Earhart was home schooled for  most of her life, and she gained her pilots license at an early age. In December of  1920, Earhart's father took Amelia to an airshow in Long Beach, California. This is  where she first became interested in flying. After earning her aviator's license, she  accomplished a feat that only a few men had ever done: flying solo across the  Atlantic. She earned national fame for this and was soon a household name.
 Tragically, Earhart was lost in an attempt to fly around the world in 1937. She was  never found. The theories about how she met her end are countless. Many think she  fell victim to the Japanese prior to the start of World War II. This thinking was rooted  in the idea that Earhart was a spy. Other outlandish theories include alien kidnapping,  but most likely she had mechanical difficulties flying over the Pacific Ocean. Earhart  was either killed instantly, or survived, according to one popular theory, and lived out  her days on a deserted island.

327. CHARLES LINDBERGH: A SUPERSTAR PILOT
 Charles Lindbergh is an American hero, who took the nation, and the world by  storm as a 25-year-old pilot in 1927. That was the year Lindbergh flew from New  York City to Paris across the Atlantic Ocean solo. Aviation technology was not very  advanced during that time period. Lindbergh's plane The Spirit of St. Louis was  believed by many to be simply too small to make the solo flight across the great  Atlantic. Just carrying enough fuel for the flight was a challenge, and so was the trip  itself. Because of the limitations on the speed of aircraft at the time, it would take  many hours to make the trip; it was generally accepted that a pilot could not make it  alone. Lindbergh would not be deterred though.
 Lindbergh was working as a mail pilot when he decided to make his cross-Atlantic  flight. Six well-known and trained aviators had lost their lives trying to make the  flight before him, so his odds for success were not in his favor. On the morning of  May 20, 1927, Lindbergh launched his small plane from Roosevelt Field in New York,  and determined to reach Paris. The flight was an international event as Lindbergh's  progress was reported by report stations throughout his flight. Lindbergh faced many  dangers and challenges during his flight, including foul weather, and flying blind  through thick fog. He also had to fight his fatigue during the nearly 54-hour flight.
 It was all well worth the trouble when Lindbergh landed in Paris on Saturday  night, May 21, 1927. More than 150,000 French citizens had gathered to join the  celebration of his historic flight. Lindbergh had become an international superstar  literally overnight. He came home to an adoring American public that celebrated his  fame with a parade through the streets of New York City.

328. SUSAN B. ANTHONY: THE FIRST WOMEN'S RIGHTS
 ACTIVIST  Long before the women's movement of the late 1960s and 70s, lived a 19th  Century woman by the name of Susan B. Anthony. Anthony was fighting for women's  rights long before the social revolution 50 years ago. She was born in 1820 to a  Quaker family. Quakers are a close-knit, faith-based group of people who live a very  simple and strict life. It is a traditional way of life where gender roles are clearly  defined.
 She spent much of her early life fighting for social change. She was an anti slavery abolitionist, teacher, author, and was a leading figure in gaining women the  right to vote, and to hold office. The suffrage movement was designed to gain voting  rights for women who previously had no voice in government. Another social cause  Anthony was heavily involved with was the anti-slavery movement. Anthony made  her family farm available for like-minded people to have anti-slavery meetings. She  was involved in the abolitionist movement until the end of the American Civil War,  when slavery was abolished. She then turned her attention to women's rights.
 Anthony founded a weekly publication called "The Revolution", which she used to  publish women's rights literature. The newspaper's motto was "Men their rights, and  nothing more; women their rights, and nothing less."  In 1872, after touring the country trying to build momentum for women's rights,  she illegally voted in the presidential election. She was arrested and fined, even  though she fought. Anthony never paid the fine. The incident served to bring more  awareness to the struggle women had to endure. Anthony fought the good fight until  her death in 1905 at the age of 84. She is honored today by the United States mint  with the Susan B. Anthony $1 coin.

329. BILL CLINTON: POPULAR MODERN AMERICAN
 PRESIDENT  William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton was the 43rd American president, presiding over  the country for eight years from 1993 to 2001. He was the third youngest president  to hold the office, behind Theodore Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy. Clinton was a  very popular president, who led the country during one of the most successful eras in  American history. His economic policies contributed greatly to the country's economic  strength during his tenure. Clinton is a member of the Democratic Party, and served  as governor of the state of Arkansas for two five-year terms. He is credited with  overhauling the state's education system during his tenure.
 Clinton presided over the longest, peacetime economic expansion in American  history. He is married to Hillary Clinton who he met at Yale Law School. Hillary Clinton  was Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013, after serving as senator of the state of  New York from 2001 to 2009. Additionally, Hillary Clinton is considered one of the top  prospects to gain the Democratic nomination for the presidential election in 2016.
 When Bill Clinton left office in 2001, he enjoyed the highest approval rating from the  American public in the history of the United States, but his presidency was not  without controversy.
 Bill Clinton's presidency was marred by the Monica Lewinsky affair. Lewinski was a  White House intern who engaged in sexual activity with the president. Bill Clinton  denied any wrongdoing, but his political opponents, the Republicans, pursued Clinton  in an effort to damage his reputation and the Democratic Party in general. Republican  politicians tried to have Clinton impeached from office and dogged him for years. In  the end, Clinton survived the controversy, and completed his successful term as  president. Hillary stood by him during the dark times, and the couple remains  together to this day.

330. FORREST GUMP: AN AMERICAN FILM LEGEND
 Forrest Gump is a 1994 film depicting the life of a simple, Alabama-born man who  achieves great success in life despite being mentally slow. The lead character is  played by the great Tom Hanks, who is involved in many of the most significant  moments in American history. The film and character have become iconic figures in  American society because of its message that any feat can be accomplished no  matter what obstacles are faced.
 Gump was born to a single mother in rural Alabama during the 1950s. He is a  slow-witted boy who seems unaware of his surroundings, or purpose in life. A school  counselor tells his mother Gump's IQ is so low, and would be placed into a special  vocational program. His mother convinces the counselor to disregard Gump's low IQ  score. Forrest is allowed to attend a regular public school.
 Because of his athletic ability, Gump gets a scholarship to play football at the  University of Alabama, where he excels at the game. Upon graduation, he is  approached by an army recruiter, and joins the military, where again he excels. Gump  is awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for saving the lives of many of his  fellow troops during a vicious firefight in the Vietnam War.
 After his time in the service, Gump wins an international ping pong competition in  China, brings down President Richard Nixon while staying at the infamous, Watergate  Hotel, meets three presidents, and goes on several, cross-country runs that gain  massive media attention. Throughout his life, Gump maintains solid relationship with  his friends from the Army, and dearly loves his only childhood friend and sweetheart,  Jenny. Forrest Gump touches the American spirit like no other film ever has.

331. LANCE ARMSTRONG: AMERICAN HERO OR VILLAIN?
 There is no American sports celebrity is as controversial as Lance Armstrong.
 Armstrong enjoyed years of glory from adoring American public during his cycling  career for nearly a decade. Between 1999 through 2005, Armstrong won the famous  Tour de France road cycling event seven consecutive years. This is a feat that no  other person in the history of the famed race has ever accomplished. He was an  American hero who benefited greatly from his fame and fortune. During those years,  no other athlete in the United States was more popular than Armstrong.
 Armstrong was born in 1971 in Plano, Texas. By the age of 12, he had been  competing in swimming competitions with great success. At 16, Armstrong began  competing in the grueling triathlon races, where contestants must cycle, swim, and  run for several miles. His Tour de France records were superior to any other racer in  the history of the annual event, which began in 1903. However, Armstrong had a  dark side.
 After he retired from competition in 2011, allegations of drug use began to  surface. The United States Anti-Doping Agency began investigating the cyclist, and  eventually found he had used performance-enhancing drugs during his years  competing in the Tour de France.
 Armstrong denied any wrongdoing, but the USADA stripped him of his titles. He  was also barred from ever competing professionally again. This was followed by a  lifetime ban from the Union Cycliste Internationale, an international racing  organization. Armstrong did not admit to using drugs until January, 2013 on the  Oprah Winfrey Show. He claimed that he was not the only athlete using drugs on the  tour, and that he was being singled out because of his success. However, that did not  matter; this American hero had fallen.

332. THOMAS JEFFERSON: AN AMERICAN PATRIOT
 There was a time on this land when the United States of America did not exist.
 Prior to the 1770s, the region was largely Indian country with the exception of 13  British colonies in the northeast part of the country. These colonies were known as  the American Colonies, and were under British rule. The 13 colonies were a loosely  connected group of individual states that were governed by the Continental Congress.
 The congress had been at odds against the British for several years, primarily  because of the taxes that were being levied by their Parliament.
 In 1775, after a year of war between the American colonies and England, the  colonists decided it was time to become independent. The English Parliament had  issued two unpopular taxes, which were imposed to help support the British after the  end of the Seven Years War. The colonists asked Thomas Jefferson to write the  Declaration of Independence arguing that since the colonies had no voice in  Parliament's matters, they should not be taxed.
 The declaration was drafted by Jefferson on July 2, 1776, and was approved by  the Continental Congress on July 4th. Today, July 4th is celebrated in the United  States as the day of independence from British rule. The declaration features what  has been called the most famous sentence in the English language. It reads: "We  hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are  endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life,  Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness." These words were written to represent the  moral and ethical standards the new country was meant to follow. It is a beautifully  written document, and it stands for all that this country tries to be.

333. RUSSELL CROWE: A GREAT HOLLYWOOD LEADING
 MAN  Russell Crowe, born in New Zealand in 1964, is a musician, actor, and  philanthropist. He has gained considerable success in the film industry. Crowe spent  much of his life living in Australia and the United States, but it was in New Zealand  where he first became involved in the entertainment industry. As a teenager, Crowe  began developing his musical talent, but he found little success. He had several of his  songs played on New Zealand radio, but none made the charts. He turned to acting  after moving to Australia, where he appeared in several stage productions, including  the Rocky Horror Picture Show. He landed a role in the television comedy Neighbors,  and made his film debut in 1990.
 Crowe became a popular movie star for his performance in the epic film Gladiator.
 In the film he portrays a Roman general who is slated to become a high-ranking  official, but the leader dies, and is replaced by his evil, neurotic son. The new leader  fears Crowe's character, and strips him of his rank. He was put into a state of slavery,  but becomes a champion gladiator, and leads a revolt against the leader's regime.
 The film won the Academy Award for Best Picture, and Crowe won the award for Best  Actor.
 He followed his success in Gladiator with a string of highly entertaining movies,  culminating with the 2001 film A Beautiful Mind. The film follows the life of Nobel  Prize winner, John Nash. Crowe expertly plays Nash, who is brilliant, but suffers from  paranoid schizophrenia. Crowe's performance earned him several awards for Best  Actor and the Best Movie Oscar. Crowe was also critically acclaimed for his portrayal  of the fictional character Captain Jack Aubrey.
 Crowe has been generous with his fortune. He has donated money to several  causes in his home country of New Zealand, Australia, and in the United States.

334. ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER: FROM TERMINATOR TO
 GOVERNOR  Arnold Schwarzenegger is one of the most recognizable celebrities in the United  States of America. The Austrian-born star came to the U.S. in the late 1960s when he  was an international star in the body-building circuit. Since then, Schwarzenegger  has had multiple careers as an actor, politician, and philanthropist.
 Schwarzenegger began weight training at the age of 15. By the time he was 20  years old, he had won the prestigious Mr. Universe title. The professional body building honor is awarded annually, but this was not his only body-building title on his  resume. He won seven Mr. Olympia titles during his body-building career. Additionally,  he wrote several books on the subject. His body-building career spanned from 1965  to 1980.
 His film career began in 1970 when he starred in a little-known movie called  Hercules in New York. However, from these beginnings, Schwarzenegger cultivated a  long, and successful career as an action movie star in Hollywood. His movies are  some of the most popular films to ever show in the U.S. His most recognizable role  was arguably as the Terminator in the film series of the same name. Following a long  and successful film career, Schwarzenegger, who was always interested in politics,  began a political career that culminated with his election to two terms as California's  Governor.
 Schwarzenegger was first elected governor in October, 2003, running on a  Republican Party platform. He enjoyed moderate success as governor in his first  years, but struggled greatly after that. He had many political opponents who cited  that he had no political experience, and had won the elections simply because of his  popularity. Schwarzenegger's term in office was rocked by sexual misconduct  allegations that tainted his political career. He remains a very popular cultural figure  in the United States.

335. JOHNNY DEPP: AN UNUSUAL TALENT
 Johnny Depp is an American film star known for taking eccentric roles that many  Hollywood stars would not. He has won two awards for best actor, including a Golden  Globe Award and a Screen Actor's Guild Award. Depp has played some of the most  endearing characters in modern American film history, making him one of the most  popular actors in America today.
 Depp was born in Kentucky, but raised in Florida. He dropped out of school at the  age of 15 to pursue a career as a Rock 'n' Roll musician. He gained very little success  as a musician, and was introduced to acting by his former wife while they were  visiting Los Angeles.
 After debuting in A Nightmare on Elm Street, Depp got his first break when he  was cast in the popular TV show 21 Jump Street. The show ran for several years, and  Depp began getting noticed by Hollywood producers. His first huge hit was playing an  artificial character in the film Edward Scissorhands. This role was the first of many  odd characters played by Depp. Edward Scissorhands was critically acclaimed, and  won several industry awards.
 Depp followed his success in Edward Scissorhands with a series of strong roles. In  1999, he played Ichabod Crane in the movie Sleepy Hollow. His performance was well  received by critics, and audiences alike. His most successful role was playing Captain  Jack Sparrow in The Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, another eccentric character.
 This role was described as a difficult one that only someone like Depp could pull off.
 In 2005, Depp starred in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, playing once again a  very eccentric character that lived in a chocolate factory.

336. DONALD STERLING: THE CONTROVERSIAL
 BILLIONAIRE  Donald Sterling is an American businessman who gained much of his wealth  during the real estate boom in California many years ago. He is also the owner of the  Los Angeles Clippers, a professional basketball team of the National Basketball  Association. Sterling has owned the Clippers since buying the team in 1981. Although  Sterling is a very successful and rich man, his team has seen very little success in the  NBA over the years. In recent years, the Clippers have made some strides in the  league, having made the playoffs every year since 2011.
 Sterling was recently in the news for a very different reason, though. On April 25,  2014, a controversial news and entertainment show aired a recorded conversation  between Sterling and a female friend, where Sterling is heard making racial  comments about some of her black friends. Sterling is not kind in his description of  these friends. He said he did not want her bringing any black people to his Clippers  games because he did not want her to be seen publicly with them.
 Sterling's rant gained international attention. The NBA is made up of more than  90 percent black players, so many people questioned how Sterling could feel this way  about many of his own employees. His comments created an immediate backlash  from the black community and from Americans as a whole. He was under pressure  from the NBA to sell the team after many black people commented/span> that they  no longer would attend his games.

337. MAGIC JOHNSON: FROM SUPERSTAR TO
 BUSINESSMAN  No one ever out-smiled Magic Johnson. Ever since he was a young man, Johnson  has been known for his great attitude toward life. It just happens that Johnson is also  one of the greatest basketball players to ever play in the National Basketball  Association. Johnson played his entire career for the Los Angeles Lakers. The Lakers  are the best franchise in the NBA over the past 40 years, having won more  championships than any other teams.
 During the 1980s, the Lakers were known as "Showtime" because of the team's  high-paced, and high-scoring style of play. Much of this style can be attributed to the  charismatic Johnson. His style developed at an early age when he was playing  basketball in his home state of Michigan. He attended Michigan State University, and  led its team to the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) title in 1979.
 He was taken by the Lakers as their first pick in the college draft, and he never  left. Johnson played for the Lakers from 1980 through 1991, and then played for a  few games in 1996. During the 80s, he led the Lakers to eight championship  appearances, and won five. No other team had dominated the game in a single  decade since the Boston Celtics in the 60s. He also won an Olympic Gold Medal in  basketball, and won the Most Valuable Player Awards multiple times, but his most  endearing quality remained as one of the nicest and well-liked player in the game.
 Today Johnson still calls Los Angeles his home. He has transitioned from  basketball player to coach, to team owner, and businessman. He owns a successful  franchise of movie theaters called the Magic Johnson Theaters. Johnson was also part  of the investment group that purchased the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team in  2012. He is married, and has two sons and a daughter.

338. PHIL JACKSON: WINNING AT ALL LEVELS
 Phil Jackson is an American basketball coach, and general manager. He used to be  a basketball player, and played for several seasons in the National Basketball  Association during the 1970s. He played for the New York Knicks for most of his  career after being drafted by the team in 1967. He was a top reserve player for the  Knicks team that won the NBA Championship in 1973. Because of a spinal injury, he  did not continue to play for the team. Jackson was an average player, who found  some success in the NBA, but his phenomenal success in the league came as a coach.
 As coach of the Chicago Bulls, Jackson's teams won six titles in nine years. He  was hired in 1987 by the Bulls as an assistant coach, and took over the head  coaching job in 1989. Helping him win the titles was Michael Jordan. Jordan is one of  the most successful athletes ever to play the game of basketball. Many people claim  that Jackson was able to win his six titles because of Jordan, while others point out  that Jordan preceded Jackson without ever winning a title. In any event, the duo  worked, and the rest is NBA history.
 Jackson join the Los Angeles Lakers as coach in 2000. The Lakers were in a  similar situation as the Bulls during that time. The team had plenty of talent, but  lacked leadership. Jackson, once again, provided that. During his time with the  Lakers, Jackson's teams won five NBA titles, nearly matching the Bulls run. Jackson  also benefited from having Kobe Bryant and other talented players on his roster, but  his success was now firmly cemented in basketball lore. Jackson is currently the  general manager of his old team, the New York Knicks.

339. JERRY SPRINGER: THE MAN BEHIND THE SHOW
 Perhaps no other name in daytime variety shows brings out more emotion than  Jerry Springer. Springer has been a talk show host for several years on the show that  bears his name, the Jerry Springer Show. His show is described as a tabloid talk show  because of the controversial subjects covered, and because of the people who appear  on the show. Springer does not invite celebrities to his show. Instead, he opts to  showcase regular Americans from all walks of life. He is a former politician who  served one term as mayor of the city of Cincinnati, Ohio, in the 1970s.
 His show debuted in 1991 as a politically themed talk show, where he invited  celebrities such as Oliver North, and the Reverend Jesse Jackson. The show was  designed to mimic another popular daytime talk show, the Phil Donahue show. The  show found moderate success, but in 1994, in order to boost ratings, the show  transitioned to a more sensational format. In this new format, everyday people were  confronted by family members, and friends, about controversial subjects.
 The show has been highly-rated for decades now, but has also come under fire  from many groups who claim the subjects are not appropriate for daytime television.
 Springer does not shy away from any subject. Guests are confronted about subjects  such as adultery, prostitution, homosexuality, and hate group membership. Often,  these confrontations become violent, where guests engaged in physical  confrontations. The Springer show has spawned numerous copycat shows over the  years, but it still out-rates every other show of its kind.
 In May of 2000, controversy hit the show when a female guest on the Springer  show was murdered by her ex-husband after viewing the episode. Springer, his  producer, and the network were sued by the woman's children. The suit alleged that  the controversial nature of the show led to the murder, eventually though, the suit  was dropped.

340. THE WRIGHT BROTHERS: THE FATHERS OF AVIATION
 In today's world, it is not unusual for people to board a plane, and be halfway  around the world within hours. The jumbo jetliners in use today are commonplace in  most developed countries, but there was a time, not long ago, before air travel was  even possible. That was before Orville, and Wilbur Wright built and flew their first  aircraft in the early 20th Century.
 On December 17, 1903, the brothers made their historic flight in Kitty Hawk,  North Carolina, officially opening a new era in travel. Their contributions to the new  science of aeronautics continued for at least 10 years after that historic day. What  separated the Wright brothers from other aviation pioneers was that the brothers  developed an effective mechanism to control their airplane. Their three-axis control  system is still in use today, more than 100 years after its development.
 The first flight was not a very long one. It totaled only 120 feet long, 10 feet high,  and only 12 seconds in duration, but it was flight. Orville piloted the plane, as Wilbur  ran alongside. There were only five eyewitnesses to the flight, but one photographer  captured the image on film, and the rest was aviation history.
 The brothers were very protective of their new invention, and made it difficult for  reporters to chronicle their efforts. This led to widespread rumors that the entire  thing was a hoax. For the next several years, the brothers worked to refine their  flying machine in secret, leading to more doubt. However, in 1908, the brothers took  their invention to Le Mans, France to put on an exhibition. Wilbur guided his aircraft  making turns and other maneuvers, which amazed the crowd. Soon, the Wright  Brothers were famous. They changed the way people travel.

341. JOHN LENNON: A FOUNDING MEMBER OF THE
 BEATLES  John Lennon is one of the most complex individuals ever to walk the face of the  earth. The British-born musician is a true international icon who influenced the world  with his message of peace and love. In America, Lennon is one of the most loved  people to ever call the United States home.
 Lennon was one of the founding members of the international super group, the  Beatles. He, along with Paul McCartney, formed the early creative brain trust of a  group that changed music worldwide. The group's success has never been duplicated,  and its music is as popular today as it was in the 1960s and 70s.
 Lennon wrote, or co-wrote some of the most memorable tunes ever written in the  Rock 'n' Roll genre. He found great success as a member of the Beatles, which is the  most commercially successful group in history, and as a solo artist. Lennon was also a  political activist. His views on religion and politics caused a great deal of controversy  in the United States. He was an outspoken critic of the country's involvement in the  Vietnam conflict. His popularity caused great concern with government officials  because he had the attention of the young people in America at the time.
 Lennon had been living in New York for several years, where he was being  watched by the FBI in order to find grounds to deport him from the United States. He  used flamboyant gimmicks to spread his word of peace. In this passive protest,  Lennon and his wife Ono addressed the media from their beds claiming people should  "make love, not war." Lennon was killed on December 8, 1980 by a crazy gunman  outside his home in New York City. A memorial plaque at the site of his death is one  of the most visited sites in the country.

342. D.B. COOPER: THE INFAMOUS SKYJACKER
 Aircraft hijacking, or skyjacking is the intentional taking of an airplane usually  done for political purposes. Unlike ground vehicle hijacking, which is done for  financial gain for the most part, skyjacking is a darker, more dangerous, potentially  life-threatening action. During the mid-1960s to the 1970s, about 160 aircraft were  skyjacked worldwide. In the United States, many had taken control of aircraft, but no  one had ever escaped the reach of law enforcement with one glaring exception, D.B.
 Cooper.
 D.B. Cooper's real name is Dan Cooper, but his legend began as D.B. Cooper  because of a mistake by the media in 1971. On November 24, Cooper hijacked a  Boeing 727 jetliner after purchasing a one-way ticket from Portland to Seattle,  Washington. Cooper demanded $200,000, and four parachutes upon arrival to  Seattle. Authorities complied with his ransom request, and Cooper let all 36  passengers, and most of the crew off the plane at that time.
 Once back in the air, Cooper directed the pilot to fly to Mexico, but the jet's fuel  was not enough to make there without stopping to refuel. It was decided to land in  Reno, Nevada for refueling. When the aircraft reached Reno, Cooper was not on  board. It is thought that Cooper jumped out of the aircraft somewhere in the wooded  forests of Oregon. He had ordered the plane to fly at the lowest possible speed, and  to fly at only a 10,000 foot elevation. The legend of D.B. Cooper was born.
 To this date, the Cooper skyjacking is the only case that is unresolved in the  United States. Cooper was never found, nor was any evidence of the $200,000, and  his parachute. Many believe Cooper could not survive a drop of such a great altitude,  while others say the absence of any of the money, or any evidence of his death  proves he survived. In any event, D.B. Cooper is a true American legend.

343. O.J. SIMPSON: AMERICAN HERO AND VILLAIN
 No name evokes more controversy in the United States than O.J. Simpson. He has  been in the American spotlight for decades ever since he was a star football player at  the University of Southern California, a premier academic university which is  primarily known for its full, rich football tradition.
 USC is one of the greatest places for future pro football players to get their start.
 Simpson knew this when he transferred to the school in the mid-1960s from San  Francisco Community College. At USC, Simpson found fame. His fortune was to come  later. He helped the university reach the coveted Rose Bowl berth in 1968, following  an outstanding 1967 season where he led the nation in rushing yards. His 64-yard  run against arch-rival UCLA, in what many people say was the greatest game in  college football history, is what legends are made of. Simpson later played in the  National Football League, where he gained more fame and fortune. Upon retirement,  he turned to an acting career where he starred in many commercials, and eventually  movies.
 Unfortunately, Simpson's life took a tragic turn years later. He was accused of  murdering his wife, and her friend in the early 90s. His trial was one of the most  watched events in the history of television. Simpson was acquitted of the murder, due  largely to his "Dream Team" of the high-priced attorneys. Many people believed that  Simpson committed the murder and got away with it.
 Simpson was later convicted in a Nevada court for several offenses, and is  currently serving time in prison. Many believe this conviction was retribution for his  earlier crimes.

344. BILLIE JEAN KING: AN ADVOCATE OF EQUAL RIGHTS
 FOR WOMEN  It was not so long ago that women in the United States were treated like second class citizens. They did not have the same basic rights as their male counterparts  had. At one time, women were not allowed to vote, own property, or get education.
 Since those dark times, the women of America have made great strides in their  struggle for equality. One of their heroes was the great Billie Jean King.
 King was a professional tennis player, who gained great success during her career  on the women's tennis court. She won 39 Grand Slam Titles, 12 singles, 16 women's  doubles, and 11 mixed doubles. She found success in just about every venue she  participated in, including the Federation Cup Championships. King's greatest  accomplishment, however, was an exhibition match that took place in Houston, Texas  on September 20, 1973.
 The 29-year-old King, who was at the top of her professional career at the time,  faced a former Wimbledon Champion, Bobby Riggs. Riggs was one of the best men's  players during his prime in the late 1930s and 40s. The 55-year-old Riggs challenged  King to an exhibition match claiming that the women's game was far inferior to the  men's game. He said that even a 55-year-old, "washed-up" former player could beat  the top woman in the world. The stage was set for the match. However, it was not  much of a match at all.
 King soundly defeated Riggs without much trouble. The match was later exposed  for what many people claimed it would be: a showcase for King to demonstrate that  women could compete against men. The victory was part of the equal rights  movement that was sweeping the nation during that time. King became an outspoken  advocate of equal rights for women.

345. MADONNA: A MUSICAL LEGEND
 Madonna Louise Ciccone is a popular singer, songwriter, and actress in the United  States. Madonna, as she is commonly known, burst onto the music scene in the early  1980s with a style that had never been seen before. Her sexy, and scantily clad  costumes and performances both delighted and aggravated the American public for  years. She excelled at pushing the boundaries of what most Americans perceived as  acceptable in her music videos and live performances. Madonna did not shy away  from controversial subjects, either.
 Madonna was born in Bay City, Michigan in 1958. She moved to New York City to  pursue a career in dancing as a young woman. She began her music career with a  couple of club bands in New York, but was soon noticed by music industry executives.
 In 1983, she released her first album titled simply, "Madonna." This was just the  beginning for the superstar. She followed her initial success with several hit albums  and singles such as Like a Virgin, and Into the Groove. She coupled her commercial  success in music with successful performances in a series of movies such as  Desperately Seeking Susan, and Evita. It seemed there was nothing Madonna could  not do.
 One of Madonna's defining characteristics is her ability to reinvent herself. Many  artists find success in the very competitive, entertainment industry, but most are only  successful for a short period of time, but not Madonna. She has sold more than 300  million records worldwide to date. She ranked second only to the Beatles on  Billboard's list of Greatest Acts of the 20th Century.
 Madonna's career has not been without controversy, though. She has been the  subject of several lawsuits for her acts, but she survived, and thrived through it all.
 She is still one of the best female artists in the United States today.

346. NEIL ARMSTRONG: THE MAN WHO WALKED ON THE
 MOON  The United States of America is the only country ever to land a manned  spacecraft on the surface of the moon. The first person to walk on the moon was Neil  Armstrong. Armstrong set foot on the surface of the moon on July 20, 1969, in what  was one of the most watched telecasts in the history of the country. Armstrong  became an instant celebrity, whose name became a household word for generations  to come.
 The lunar landing mission was carried out on the Apollo 11 Spacecraft. Armstrong  was the mission commander for the historic flight, and was the second and last  mission flown by him. There were complications involving the landing module that  Armstrong dealt with at the time of the landing. The module was coming in faster  than planned. It was destined to miss the landing site by several miles, but some  quick thinking by Armstrong prevented a potential disaster.
 When Armstrong did step onto the lunar surface, his words echoed throughout the  country and the world: "That's one small step for man, one giant leap for Mankind."  Years later, Armstrong and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)  insisted that the quote was incorrect, and was obscured by interference. However, the  quote is remembered forever in its original form.
 Armstrong received the Congressional Medal of Freedom from President Richard  Nixon, and was later awarded the Congressional Space Medal of Honor by President  Jimmy Carter. The program was discontinued in the early 1970s. Other countries  have landed unmanned missions to the Earth's largest satellite, but to date, no other  person has walked on the moon since then. Neil Armstrong, a true American hero,  died in 2012 folloing complications from a surgical procedure.

347. MARK TWAIN: A GREAT AMERICAN AUTHOR
 Samuel Langhorne Clemens, best known as Mark Twain, is an American author  and humorist. He wrote two of the most significant novels, The Adventures of Tom  Sawyer, and Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. He grew up in Hannibal, Missouri, which  provided the settings for his novels.
 Clemens held a variety of odd jobs as a young man. He was a journalist, miner,  printer's apprentice, and typesetter, but journalism was what he liked doing best. His  writing style earned him praise from critics worldwide. William Faulkner, another  great American author, called him "The Father of American Literature."  Twain was already a very successful writer when he wrote The Adventures of Tom  Sawyer. The main character Tom Sawyer was based on his own experiences as a  child. His best friends were also based on real-life friends Twain grew up with.
 Huckleberry Finn, the main character of his finest work, was also based on a  childhood friend.
 Twain was a prolific writer who penned several books, and other publications.
 Most of his writing was taken from his life in the western part of the United States  while traveling with his brother Orion. He was born Christian, but later in life  questioned his faith, and developed negative feelings toward organized religion. He  was once quoted as saying, "If Christ were here, now there is one thing he would not  be - Christian." Twain died in 1910 from a heart attack at the age of 74.

348. CHRISTOPHER REEVE: A REAL-LIFE SUPERMAN
 "Look up in the sky! It's a bird; it's a plane. No. It's Superman!" This is one of the  most iconic lines in television history. It signaled the beginning of a new episode of  The Adventures of Superman. The 1960s show is just one in a series of shows, plays,  movies, and comic books that depict the "Man of Steel." The most iconic actor  portraying Superman was Christopher Reeve. Reeve starred in four movies during the  late 1970s and 80s.
 In the 1978 movie classic Superman, Reeve was cast as the legendary American  hero based largely on his physical attributes, although he was an accomplished actor.
 Reeve had the classic Superman look. He was 6'4" tall, weighed 215 lbs., with a  square jaw, and other manly features that made him perfect for the role. The film  won critical acclaim, and multiple awards, including a "Special Achievement Award for  Visual Effects." One of the selling points for the movie was that the special effects  were so good that audience would believe that a man can fly after seeing this film.
 Reeve went on to star in three sequels to the original movie, and had a very solid  acting career in several movies after that. Tragically, Reeve and his family were hit  with a devastating blow on May 27, 1995. Reeve was riding his horse through a  steeplechase course jumping over obstacles. His horse suddenly stopped, throwing  Reeve to the ground. Reeve suffered shattered vertebrae, and instantly lost the use  of his arms and legs.
 Reeve refused to give up. He spent the rest of his years advocating for spinal cord  injury advancement in treatment and technology. He used his celebrity status to help  the cause, but sadly, Reeve died at the age of 52 in 2004 due to complications from  his injuries. He will always be remembered to his fans as the Man of Steel though.

349. RICHARD M. NIXON: A PRESIDENCY LOST
 Richard Milhous Nixon was the 37th president of the United States, and the only  one to resign from office in the history of the country. Born on January 9, 1913 in  Yorba Linda, California, Nixon was a Republican Party member who served as vice  president under President Dwight David Eisenhower in the 1950s. Nixon ran for  president for the first time in 1960, losing to the very charismatic and young  Democrat, John F. Kennedy. The 1960 election was one of the closest elections in  history. Kennedy went on to become one of the most popular presidents ever.
 Despite his loss to Kennedy in 1960, Nixon bounced back in the 1968 election  when he defeated Democrat, Hubert Humphrey in a landslide victory. The country  was in turmoil during the 60s. The conflict in Vietnam was raging, the country was  reeling from the assassinations of John F. Kennedy, and his brother Senator Robert  Kennedy, and Martin Luther King Jr. Nixon's victory indicated the country was ready  for a conservative leadership during these tough times.
 Nixon won the 1972 election over Democrat George McGovern in another  landslide victory, which seemed to establish Nixon's legacy as a great president.
 Among his accomplishments was to open trade with China, and his promise to end  the conflict in Vietnam. However, Nixon would end up resigning from office just a year  after his victory.
 It was discovered that the Republican Party, with Nixon's knowledge, had secretly  recorded the Democratic headquarters at the Watergate Hotel in Washington D.C.
 during the weeks leading up to the election. Nixon tried to cover up the scandal, but  the pressure was too great. Nixon was forced to resign in disgrace rather than be  impeached from office, which means to be removed from office by the U.S. Congress.
 He became the first president ever to quit while serving in office.

350. CLINT EASTWOOD: A FILMMAKER LIKE NO OTHER
 "Go ahead, make my day" is one of the most famous cinema lines ever spoken in  the history of Hollywood. The actor was Clint Eastwood, and the film was 1983's  Sudden Impact. Eastwood's words became an instant catchphrase that many  Americans can recite to this day. Eastwood is quite possibly the epitome of the macho  American man. He holds icon-like status among males for portraying the tough guy in  nearly all his films.
 Eastwood was born in 1930 in San Francisco before coming to Los Angeles at an  early age. He briefly attended Los Angeles City College, but soon dropped out to  pursue an acting career. After appearing in a couple of low-budget films, Eastwood  got his big break in the old TV western Rawhide. His character Rowdy Yates was an  instant celebrity, and it launched Eastwood's incredible career. Eastwood first burst  onto the big screen with his roles in three western movies in the 1960s. The so-called  Spaghetti Westerns, which were called that because of their ties to Italian cinema,  were all very successful, and made Eastwood a household name.
 Eastwood followed his success with a string of movies that is unparalleled in  Hollywood history. He starred in the very popular Dirty Harry franchise, where he,  once again, played the tough guy. In this series, Dirty Harry is a San Francisco police  officer who takes matters into his own hands. This troubles his superiors to no end,  but Harry always wins. This persona delighted the American movie audiences,  especially the men.
 Acting was not the only talent Eastwood would eventually display. He became an  Oscar-winning director also. Arguably, his best film as a director was Million Dollar  Baby, but it is hard to pick one film from his impressive list of movies. He is still  active in film at the age of 74.

351. MICHAEL MOORE: EXPOSING THE TRUTH
 There is perhaps no other director in the American film industry that is more  controversial than Michael Moore. Moore's specialty is exposure. He loves to expose  social issues. He is a political activist, and a social critic. His films have a way of  eliciting strong emotional responses.
 Moore was born in Flint, Michigan in 1954. His father was an assembly-line worker  at the General Motors, an automobile-manufacturing plant; his mother was a  secretary. He attended the University of Michigan, Flint campus, where he dropped  out after his first year. He found work as a journalist with a couple of different local  publications, but was fired from one of his jobs because of a controversy. Moore  wanted to run a story about American involvement in Nicaragua, but his editors  refused, which led to his dismissal. He was awarded $58,000 in an out-of-court  settlement after he sued his employers.
 Moore used the money to start making documentaries. His first was "Roger & Me,"  which was a piece designed to expose GM's closure of the Flint plant and its decision  to open a plant in Mexico, where wages were much lower. His film exposes the greed  corporations like GM cutting off the lifeline of many American workers so that GM  could make more profit. GM had reported record profits before the closure, which  irritated Moore greatly.
 He followed this film with a string of documentaries that touched on many of the  social and political problems Americans face daily. His film "Fahrenheit 9/11," probes  the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the United States in 2001. He is not  kind to the George W. Bush administration for their lack of response to the attacks,  and to the Bush family's alleged ties to Osama Bin Laden, the mastermind of the  attack.

352. BILL MAHER: MR. LIBERAL
 Being controversial is a right every American has, and William 'Bill' Maher uses  that right about as well as any other person in the country. Maher is an actor,  comedian, political satirist, and talk show host. He was born in New York City in 1958  into a Roman Catholic family, but today he calls himself an agnostic. One of the first  instances where Maher questioned Catholicism was when his father stopped taking  him and his sister when he was 13. He discovered his father was angry at the church  because of their stance against birth control. His father has become an outspoken  person against all organized religions ever since.
 Maher is currently the host of the HBO show "Real Time with Bill Maher." It is a  highly-rated, late night show that has received many Emmy nominations for  excellence. It is a controversial show where emotions run high between Maher and  his guests. Maher speaks his mind, and this has been a source of trouble over the  years, but it has also earned him praise.
 In 2001, Maher came under criticism for his comments about the terrorist attacks  on the United States in September of that year. President George W. Bush had  publicly called the attackers "cowards," to which Maher took exception. Maher stated  on his show that the real cowards were the Americans. "We have been the cowards,"  said Maher. "Lobbing cruise missiles from 2,000 miles away; that's cowardly." He  later said he was not criticizing the American military, but only pointing out that  America plays a large role in Middle East politics.
 Maher has also made enemies among religious organizations. He says he dislikes  religion, which he calls an unnecessary bureaucracy between people and God. He was  once very liberal about every religion, but has changed his views on Islam saying he  knows of no other religion that calls for the death of anyone who criticizes their  religion. He has also called the Mormon church ridiculous.

353. CESAR CHAVEZ: THE VOICE OF EQUALITY
 During the 1970s, one of the biggest movements occurring in the United States  was the fight for equal rights. Many members of American society felt disenfranchised  and discriminated against, especially in the workplace. Some American workers  enjoyed a living wage complete with benefits and other advantages, while others  struggled to earn enough to survive. One of the most oppressed groups of workers  during this time period was California farm workers.
 The farm workers were migrant workers who came into the country mostly  without documentation to work in the fertile fields of California's Great Central Valley.
 This region in central California has often been described as the country's fruit basket  because of its rich soil and high yields. Farm workers tended these fields during the  day, and lived and slept on the farm at night. They earned less than the state's  minimum wage, and had no fringe benefits other American workers enjoyed. Cesar  Chavez changed all that.
 Cesar Chavez, the Arizona-born civil-rights activist and labor leader, became the  voice of these workers, and began a movement to bring basic rights to this group.
 Taking the lead from the great Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Chavez began a series of  non-violent demonstrations protesting the deplorable conditions farm workers had to  endure. Many of these workers worked much longer than eight hours a day, and  received no overtime pay. Chavez, who was a farm worker himself in the 50s, led  marches, and called for boycotts. These activities were very effective in changing the  working conditions for farm workers and other oppressed workers.
 Chavez was highly recognized during his lifetime, and his legacy increased after  his death in 1993. He has reached iconic status among the Mexican-American  community.

354. HUGH HEFNER: THE GREATEST PLAYBOY
 Hugh Hefner is one of the most controversial public figures in the United States.
 He is the founder, and president of Playboy magazine, which is a men's adult  magazine. From humble beginnings in the 1950s, Hefner has grown his pornographic  industry into the multi-million-dollar enterprise, which includes his magazine  publication, TV, and Internet media.
 Born in Chicago, Illinois in 1926, Hefner led an average life growing up in the big  city. He graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and majored  in psychology. After serving two years in the United States Military, he began working  as a copy editor at Esquire magazine in the early 50s. Hefner quit his job to go out on  his own. He was determined to start a magazine that was similar to Esquire, a men's  magazine. His first "Playboy" was published from his home in 1953, without a  publication date. He did this because he was uncertain if there would be a second  edition.
 Hefner had purchased a nude picture of the famous actress, Marilyn Monroe, and  used that image as the centerfold of his first issue. The 50,000 copies sold quickly,  and Hefner became an instant success story. During the 60s, Hefner and Playboy  were at the top of their popularity. His circulation was now in the millions, and Hefner  ventured into new areas for his company. He produced films, started modeling  agencies, built hotels and resorts, and hosted two television series. His publication  was not without controversy, though  In 1963, he was arrested and stood trial for publishing a photo of American  actress, Jayne Mansfield. The charges were eventually dropped, but it was clear that  there would be challenges to his publication because of its content. Hefner  permanently moved his headquarters to Los Angeles in 1975 so that he could be  closer to the film industry. He has been married three times, and has four children.

355. TOM HANKS: A GREAT AMERICAN ACTOR
 One of the most well-respected actors in Hollywood today is Tom Hanks. He is one  of the most popular actors among American film, and television viewers. He has  gained great success as a film actor, having starred in some of the greatest movies of  his generation. He starred in films such as Splash, Forrest Gump, Philadelphia, Apollo  13, Cast Away, The Green Mile, Saving Private Ryan, and Big.
 Born in Concord, California in 1956, Hanks began his career in television in the  popular TV show Bosom Buddies, where he plays a man living in a women's  dormitory. In order to live among the women, he and his roommate must dress in  women's clothing during the evening hours after arriving from work. This series ran  for three years and made Hanks a legitimate star.
 Hanks reached film stardom in Splash, which was a very popular love story  involving Hanks as a frustrated bachelor, and a mermaid. The movie launched his film  career that featured Hanks in mostly comedic roles. Hanks would probably always be  known as a comedic actor if he did not star in his share of dramatic roles. He played  a former baseball star in A League of their Own, and a romantic lead in the popular  Sleepless in Seattle. In 1993, Hanks won an Academy Award for his portrayal as a  displaced worker who gets fired from his job because he contracts AIDS in the film  Philadelphia. He lost 35 lbs. for his role as the gay lawyer because he wanted to look  sickly. Hanks followed his Oscar-winning performance in Philadelphia with a second  Academy Award for Best Actor for his role in Forrest Gump. He became only the  second actor to win the award in consecutive years.
 Tom Hanks has used his celebrity status to address several causes, such as same sex marriage, environmental issues, and the development of alternative fuels.

356. JOHNNY CARSON: THE LATE NIGHT KING OF TV
 Johnny Carson served as host for the iconic, late-night television series The  Tonight Show for 30 years. During that time, Carson entertained generations of  American television viewers with his down-to-earth style, casual approach, and quick witted humor. The Tonight Show was already a big success when Carson took over  from the retiring Jack Paar, but Carson took the show to the next level. His style, and  grace on camera has been mimicked by many late-night talk show hosts, who have  credited Carson as their mentor.
 Carson was born thousands of miles away from the glitz of New York, and Los  Angeles, in the city of Corning, Iowa, in 1925. Carson began his entertainment career  at the age of 14 when he appeared at county fairs as a magician, which was his first  love. His family moved to the state of Nebraska when Carson was a young man, and  he served as a communications officer for the U.S. Navy during the tail end of World  War II. His broadcast career began in 1950 in Omaha, Nebraska before moving to Los  Angeles, and landing a job with a local television station.
 Carson officially became host of The Tonight Show on October 1, 1962. The show  was based in New York City until 1972 when, at Carson's request, the show was  permanently moved to the Los Angeles area. Carson hosted his show in Burbank for  the next 21 years, where he perfected his style and approach to his guests. It was  considered an honor to be invited to The Tonight Show starring Johnny Carson.
 Carson was a true entertainer. He performed many skits during his reign, where  he dressed up in costume, and played ridiculous characters, which is something  today's late-night hosts do not do. Carson was never afraid to laugh at himself.

357. HELEN KELLER: OVERCOMING DISABILITY
 Helen Keller was an American educator and journalist, who became one of the  leading humanitarians in the history of the United States. Born on June 27, 1880 in  Tuscumbia, a small town in Alabama, Keller was stricken with a childhood disease  that left her deaf, and blind. The illness Keller suffered is a mystery to this day. She  was diagnosed with "Brain Fever," by her family doctor, but most people speculated  that she suffered from either Scarlet Fever, or Meningitis. Unable to see, or hear,  Keller became difficult to deal with as her behavior was described by her family and  friends as wild.
 Soon Keller and her family developed their own type of sign language that allowed  them to communicate on a limited basis. Helen's mother sought help for her  anguished child, which eventually led to Anne Sullivan, who was a recent graduate of  the Perkins Institute for the Blind. The school had been successful in the past in  educating blind students, and Sullivan was one of its star graduates. Once Sullivan  and Keller got through the difficult beginnings, their friendship, and association lasted  for 49 years.
 Keller was determined to become educated, and to teach herself to communicate.
 After attending several schools, she became the first deaf and blind person to earn a  college degree. She became very well-known, and began a lecture tour where she  addressed social and political issues, including women's suffrage, and birth control.
 In 1920, she helped found the American Civil Liberties Union, which is still active  today. She addressed Congress to raise awareness to the plight of the blind. Through  all her accomplishments, she fell into disfavor with the American public because of  her socialist views later in her life. She died in her sleep just days before his 88th  birthday, but she lives in the American consciousness for her tireless work, and  perseverance.

358. ELVIS PRESLEY: THE KING OF ROCK 'N' ROLL
 Born in the small town of Tupelo, Mississippi, Elvis Aaron Presley grew up in  poverty. His working-class parents moved frequently throughout the state, going  from job to job. Presley grew to be one of the most recognizable and famous  American celebrities the country has ever known. He recorded countless records,  starred on the big screen, and his songs were heard on the radio by more fans than  any other artists in history.
 Presley received his first guitar at the age of 10, and soon began a musical career  that would last more than 25 years. His first success was winning a high school talent  contest in Memphis, Tennessee, while still in school. Shortly after graduation, Presley  was discovered by Sam Phillips, a record company owner. His first commercial  success came in 1954 with his hit single That's all Right. Much of Presley's success  could be attributed to his unconventional dance, and live performance style. His hip  movements and sexually-suggestive moves earned Presley much praise, and  controversy.
 In 1956, Presley recorded his first No. 1 hit Heartbreak Hotel, and his first No. 1  album, the self-titled Elvis Presley. He also signed a contract with Paramount Pictures  Studios, which was, and is still, one of the biggest Hollywood studios in the industry.
 He went on to star in several movies with Paramount. In 1957, Presley was drafted  into service by the United States Army, where he served overseas. His time in the  military did not hurt his career. Soon after his service was over in 1960, Presley  began recording music, and starring in films.
 Presley married in 1967, and had a daughter the following year. Sadly, his  marriage ended in divorce in 1973. He fell into prescription drug abuse, and put on a  great deal of weight. He died in August, 1977, resulting from complications of his  drug abuse. He still remains one of the most profitable artists in the world today.

359. FREDERICK DOUGLASS: FROM SLAVE TO
 EMANCIPATOR  Frederick Douglass was born into slavery in Talbot County, Maryland in 1818. His  exact birth date was lost to history. Many African slaves did not have their birth dates  recorded into official records during that time period because they did not have basic  human rights. They were considered property owned by their white masters. It was a  dark time in the country. Frederick Douglass helped change that.
 It was illegal in the southern states to educate blacks at that time, but Douglass  was fortunate enough to have been educated by the wife of his master, who began  teaching Douglass the alphabet when he was 12 years old. He continued his  education on his own after that. With his new reading skills, Douglass began teaching  other black slaves the New Testament. He had a sympathetic owner, who did not see  any harm in this activity, but his neighbors did not see eye to eye with him. It wasn't  long before the lessons ended, after violent measures were taken by the white  community members.
 Douglass eventually escaped slavery, and settled in the state of Massachusetts,  where he began his struggle to end slavery. Douglass became one of the most  influential people of his generation. He made powerful friends in the U.S.
 government. During one of his lecture tours in 1843, Douglass was nearly beaten to  death by an angry mob, who did not agree with his message of abolition. He fled the  country on a couple of occasions to avoid being put into a state of slavery again.
 While in Europe, Douglass spoke to enthusiastic crowds on the evils of slavery.

360. AUDIE MURPHY: AN AMERICAN WAR HERO
 Audie Murphy is the most decorated American war hero in the history of the  United States military. He was honored with every award available during his years in  the army during World War II. He also won awards for heroism from two foreign  governments, Belgium and France. His military record is impressive, as he fought  successfully in some of the most dangerous, and historic battles during the great war.
 Murphy also found success after the war as an actor who appeared in several films.
 Murphy was born into a very large family in Hunt, Texas. He was one of 12  children, and grew up in abject poverty. His father deserted his family; his mother  died at a young age, so Murphy dropped out of school to get work. Murphy held a  series of odd jobs from an early age to help the family financially, but eventually  realized that a military life was the best course to take.
 After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Murphy knew he needed to be in the  military to defend his country, but he was not yet old enough to enlist legally. With  the help of one of his older sisters, who helped provide him with false records,  Murphy enlisted into the Army at the age of 17. It wasn't long before Murphy began  making his name in the military. He first saw action in the invasion of Sicily, and was  involved in the liberation of Rome. He became famous for leading his men into a  battle while he was wounded, and out of ammunition. He won several awards for  valor.
 After the war, he launched a successful Hollywood career. His most notable film  was playing himself in the epic movie classic From Here to Eternity, which was based  on his autobiography. Murphy starred in several western-themed films. He died at the  age of 46 in a plane crash in the state of Virginia.

361. JONAS SALK: THE MAN WHO CURED THE WORLD
 During the early part of the 20th Century, polio was considered one of the  greatest health threats in the United States of America. Polio was a vicious disease  that took its victim's lives, or left them with major disabilities. In 1952, the U.S.
 suffered one of its harshest epidemics of polio in its history. More than 58,000 cases  of polio were reported that year, and 3,145 people lost their lives. Additionally, more  than 21,000 people suffered some form of paralysis that ranged from mild paralysis  to extreme cases where people became disabled. Dr. Jonas Salk is responsible for  ending that plague.
 Born in New York City on October 28, 1914, Jonas Salk grew up in modest  surroundings. His parents were not wealthy, but they were able to put food on the  table, and maintain a roof over their children's head. Salk demonstrated great  academic success from childhood. By the age of 13, he was enrolled into a school for  gifted children. He was considered a perfectionist by his peers, and succeeded  academically in a very competitive environment. In college, Salk opted to go into  medical school even though his mother wanted him to become an attorney. After  graduating from medical school, Salk began his research on polio, which was  considered a scourge of western society.
 Polio had baffled medical science since its discovery in the mid-19th Century.
 When Salk turned his attention to the disease, there was little hope that anyone  could find an adequate cure. Salk developed his vaccine in the early 1950s, and in  April of 1955, his accomplishment was heralded in newspapers across the country.
 Salk became a national hero. His vaccine effectively ended the polio epidemic in the  United States and many countries around the world.

362. CHUCK YEAGER: FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF
 SOUND  One of the greatest barriers in existence during the infancy of air travel was the  speed of sound. It was considered impossible to build and fly an airplane that could  exceed this speed, but that was before the world was introduced to Chuck Yeager.
 Yeager was already an accomplished fighter pilot in World War II, but his greatest  achievement was after the war when he served as a test pilot for the United States  Air Force. It was thought impossible to fly faster than sound during that period, and  no one knew if a pilot could survive flying at that speed, or how it would affect him if  he did survive. That did not deter Yeager, though.
 Yeager was born on February 13, 1923 in Myra, West Virginia. He served during  World War II as a fighter pilot. He did not start out as a pilot, though. Yeager enlisted  as a private who worked as an aircraft mechanic in the old Army Air Forces, where  Yeager enrolled into a special program that trained enlisted men to become pilots.
 Yeager benefited greatly from having superior eyesight. He was considered a natural  pilot early in his flight career.
 As a fighter pilot in the European Theater, Yeager was shot down in France by  German fighter planes. He avoided capture, and helped a fellow pilot to safety after  that pilot had lost his leg in the crash. Yeager was awarded a medal for his actions.
 He demonstrated exceptional talent as a pilot and once shot down five enemy fighters  in a single day. After the war, Yeager began a new career as a test pilot, where he  flew the experimental aircraft Bell X-1 into aviation history.
 On October 14, 1947, Yeager flew his X-1 faster than the speed of sound. He  became the first human being to fly faster than sound, and he went on to break more  records during his 60-year flight history. Yeager retired from the army with the rank  of Brigadier General, and has won many honors for his contributions to aviation.

363. STEVE JOBS: THE MAN AND HIS APPLE COMPUTERS
 Steve Jobs was a self-made billionaire, who brought personal computers into the  homes of nearly every American in the country. He is credited with developing the  technology that has personalized the computers. Jobs, along with his childhood friend  Steve Wozniak, co-founded Apple Computers in 1976, working out of Jobs' garage.
 Jobs was born on February 24, 1955 to parents who gave him up for adoption  shortly after birth. He was adopted by Clara and Paul Jobs. His father was a machinist  who liked to spend time with his son taking electronic components apart, and  reassembling them. This is when and where Jobs developed his interest in mechanical  reconstruction. Jobs was not the best student in high school. He was known as a  class clown, although he was very intelligent. It was in high school that he met  Wozniak.
 Both Jobs and Wozniak had a great interest in electronics, and the pair was known  for making computer technology smaller, cheaper, and more accessible to average  persons. Jobs got his start working as a video game designer for the Atari  Corporation. Once Jobs got Apple going, he sold his first computers, which were  called the Apple I, for $666.66 each. The Apple I earned Jobs nearly $800,000 its  first year, and that was just the beginning. The Apple II earned the fledgling company  nearly $140 million, and by 1980, the company was worth $1.2 billion.
 Jobs branched out his financial kingdom venturing into other businesses such as  Pixar Animation Studios, which was also very successful. He briefly left Apple to  found the NeXT Corporation, which produced both software and hardware, but NeXT  floundered, and Jobs went back to Apple to develop iPhone and iPad. Jobs was  diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2003, and eventually lost his battle with cancer  in October, 2011.

365. MARK ZUCKERBERG: THE SOCIAL REVOLUTIONIST
 The next time you decide to check your Facebook page to see if you have any new  messages, likes, or just to see what your friends are up to, you can thank Mark  Zuckerberg. Zuckerberg is the man who changed the way people keep in touch with  each other. He literally changed the world.
 Born in White Plains, New York on May 14, 1984, Zuckerberg developed an  interest in computer programming at an early age. When he was just 12 years old,  he had developed a working messaging system that his father Edward used in his  dental office. Zuckerberg had many friends who were artists, and they would come  by and draw pictures for Mark. He would then design a computer game based on the  characters drawn. In high school, Zuckerberg developed a music software program  that drew interest from several large companies. He enrolled into Harvard University  in 2002, where he developed his first social networking site for students only. The  site was very popular, but it was shut down by the school for being inappropriate.
 During his sophomore year at Harvard, Zuckerberg began working on Facebook, a  site that allowed its users to create a profile, share photos, and communicate with  other members. He dropped out his sophomore year to dedicate his work to his site.
 He moved his operation to Palo Alto, California. By the end of 2004, Facebook had  had more than 1,000,000 members.
 Zuckerberg's rise to the top has not been without controversy. Some of his  Harvard peers claimed he stole their ideas, and filed suit against Zuckerberg. The  case was settled, but it continues to be an issue. Facebook generates more than $1.5  billion in net revenues today
